Even if you’re locked out of your online account by their error they won’t wave the fees or take your money in any other way. Multiple times have falsely recorded financial agreements & when i went two separate times in the middle of the day to speak with someone to rectify the situation they left me in the waiting room for over an hour with ZERO communication that someone would be there to assist me in giving them their own money. The pudgey manager in the back office should cover his window if he’s going to eat multiple full size candy bars while ignoring eager customers wanting to again GIVE YOU MONEY. If you’re used to paying your bills on an app or handling billing issues in a few minutes over the phone this isn’t the place for you. No customer service on weekends or past 5 so forget trying to pay your bills on the weekend. You can set up autopay but you have to go in house to their 1 of 2 locations & fill out a paper. they’ll forget to file it as they have your financial arrangements in the past & they’ll make you drive all the way up to fill out the exact same paper. You can have the nicest staff in the world doesn’t cover up that y’all are stuck in the 90s.",

The most limited routes to paying your loan of any financial institution i’ve ever heard of. $10 over the phone $5 on their very own website BUT ITS FREE IF YOU SNAIL MAIL YOUR MONEY. Even if you’re locked out of your online account by their error they won’t wave the fees or take your money in any other way. Multiple times have falsely recorded financial agreements & when i went two separate times in the middle of the day to speak with someone to rectify the situation they left me in the waiting room for over an hour with ZERO communication that someone would be there to assist me in giving them their own money. The pudgey manager in the back office should cover his window if he’s going to eat multiple full size candy bars while ignoring eager customers wanting to again GIVE YOU MONEY. If you’re used to paying your bills on an app or handling billing issues in a few minutes over the phone this isn’t the place for you. No customer service on weekends or past 5 so forget trying to pay your bills on the weekend. You can set up autopay but you have to go in house to their 1 of 2 locations & fill out a paper. they’ll forget to file it as they have your financial arrangements in the past & they’ll make you drive all the way up to fill out the exact same paper. You can have the nicest staff in the world doesn’t cover up that y’all are stuck in the 90s.",

This team is unprofessional including the newer manager that aproved this treatment (New location manager at Cottonwood). I had very sweet memories with the prior manager. This bank may be local, but unfortunately has lost the local touch. I've been banking with this company for over 12yrs and will now be looking else where for my banking needs. Would not no longer recommend University Federal Credit Union - regardless of the location in the valley.",

         "The worst banking/credit experience i’ve ever gone through. The most limited routes to paying your loan of any financial institution i’ve ever heard of. $10 over the phone $5 on their very own website BUT ITS FREE IF YOU SNAIL MAIL YOUR MONEY. Even if you’re locked out of your online account by their error they won’t wave the fees or take your money in any other way. Multiple times have falsely recorded financial agreements & when i went two separate times in the middle of the day to speak with someone to rectify the situation they left me in the waiting room for over an hour with ZERO communication that someone would be there to assist me in giving them their own money. The pudgey manager in the back office should cover his window if he’s going to eat multiple full size candy bars while ignoring eager customers wanting to again GIVE YOU MONEY. If you’re used to paying your bills on an app or handling billing issues in a few minutes over the phone this isn’t the place for you. No customer service on weekends or past 5 so forget trying to pay your bills on the weekend. You can set up autopay but you have to go in house to their 1 of 2 locations & fill out a paper. they’ll forget to file it as they have your financial arrangements in the past & they’ll make you drive all the way up to fill out the exact same paper. You can have the nicest staff in the world doesn’t cover up that y’all are stuck in the 90s.",

When signing up in October I asked about cancelation policy and was told by representative Ashley 30-day notice in person was required to cancel.  I came in to cancel in May, a few days after being charged the monthly fee, and was told I would be charged 2 more times to cancel or could pay 2 monthly fees right then.  I did rely on the verbal communication when signing up.\nThe workouts are good; the place is clean, and staff is pleasant.  Booking time slots is easy but needs to be preplanned as most convenient times get taken fast.  The company’s matts are mandatory and pricey.",

The staff is awesome and always willing to help out. It is SO SO worth it. The first week, I lost 6 pounds!! You cant ask for more than that!\n\nThey have a wide range of classes so you never get bored, and you can do it whenever it fits into your schedule. No longer do you have to wake up at 6 am or wait all day to take your favorite fitness class. I cannot rave more about this place!!",

The mistake was caught very shortly after the booking was made. Based on the owners use of the accommodation, we had no choice but to cancel the reservation. Had the reservation been for a different unit we would probably have granted it, even though the rates for next season were not yet set. We strive hard to provide a high level of service and this is not typical of how we treat future and/or past guests. We have made the necessary modifications to ensure that this will not happen again. My sincere apologies go out to Joel.'}",

         "The worst banking/credit experience i’ve ever gone through. The most limited routes to paying your loan of any financial institution i’ve ever heard of. $10 over the phone $5 on their very own website BUT ITS FREE IF YOU SNAIL MAIL YOUR MONEY. Even if you’re locked out of your online account by their error they won’t wave the fees or take your money in any other way. Multiple times have falsely recorded financial agreements & when i went two separate times in the middle of the day to speak with someone to rectify the situation they left me in the waiting room for over an hour with ZERO communication that someone would be there to assist me in giving them their own money. The pudgey manager in the back office should cover his window if he’s going to eat multiple full size candy bars while ignoring eager customers wanting to again GIVE YOU MONEY. If you’re used to paying your bills on an app or handling billing issues in a few minutes over the phone this isn’t the place for you. No customer service on weekends or past 5 so forget trying to pay your bills on the weekend. You can set up autopay but you have to go in house to their 1 of 2 locations & fill out a paper. they’ll forget to file it as they have your financial arrangements in the past & they’ll make you drive all the way up to fill out the exact same paper. You can have the nicest staff in the world doesn’t cover up that y’all are stuck in the 90s.",

The mistake was caught very shortly after the booking was made. Based on the owners use of the accommodation, we had no choice but to cancel the reservation. Had the reservation been for a different unit we would probably have granted it, even though the rates for next season were not yet set. We strive hard to provide a high level of service and this is not typical of how we treat future and/or past guests. We have made the necessary modifications to ensure that this will not happen again. My sincere apologies go out to Joel.'}",

Near the end of the deposit I requested a receipt then asked me if I would like a receipt. It takes only 5-10 mins at other branches. I am just so confused why I had a bad experience.

The most limited routes to paying your loan of any financial institution i’ve ever heard of. $10 over the phone $5 on their very own website BUT ITS FREE IF YOU SNAIL MAIL YOUR MONEY. Even if you’re locked out of your online account by their error they won’t wave the fees or take your money in any other way. Multiple times have falsely recorded financial agreements & when i went two separate times in the middle of the day to speak with someone to rectify the situation they left me in the waiting room for over an hour with ZERO communication that someone would be there to assist me in giving them their own money. The pudgey manager in the back office should cover his window if he’s going to eat multiple full size candy bars while ignoring eager customers wanting to again GIVE YOU MONEY. If you’re used to paying your bills on an app or handling billing issues in a few minutes over the phone this isn’t the place for you. No customer service on weekends or past 5 so forget trying to pay your bills on the weekend. You can set up autopay but you have to go in house to their 1 of 2 locations & fill out a paper. they’ll forget to file it as they have your financial arrangements in the past & they’ll make you drive all the way up to fill out the exact same paper. You can have the nicest staff in the world doesn’t cover up that y’all are stuck in the 90s.",

The staff is awesome and always willing to help out. It is SO SO worth it. The first week, I lost 6 pounds!! You cant ask for more than that!\n\nThey have a wide range of classes so you never get bored, and you can do it whenever it fits into your schedule. No longer do you have to wake up at 6 am or wait all day to take your favorite fitness class. I cannot rave more about this place!!",

When signing up in October I asked about cancelation policy and was told by representative Ashley 30-day notice in person was required to cancel.  I came in to cancel in May, a few days after being charged the monthly fee, and was told I would be charged 2 more times to cancel or could pay 2 monthly fees right then.  I did rely on the verbal communication when signing up.\nThe workouts are good; the place is clean, and staff is pleasant.  Booking time slots is easy but needs to be preplanned as most convenient times get taken fast.  The company’s matts are mandatory and pricey.",

The word predatory really doesnt fit since it is written and all employees are trained to go over this as a part of signing up!

I never went in and got fully set up or anything so I just didn’t think any thing of it and figured I could get started when i moved back in November. You can imagine my shock when i saw three months worth $130+ taken out of my bank account since May. I called to see what was up and was told sorry there’s nothing we can do and that they just started billing people once it opened up regardless if they had been in or not. I’m just upset that they couldn’t refund me anything seemings how I never saw the place even finished or did one work out there.",

Kasi and the staff are super awesome to work with, even the owner is very friendly and down to earth.\nI like that the gym spaces are are big enough for you and a friend or two, but its still very private which let's you really focus. On top of that, there are many benifits to working in their infared saunas; you sweat more in less time really maximizing your results, but it does make you feel fresher when you are done.\nEach workout is directed by a virtual guide which makes it very easy to follow along and very ever workout they show forms for: beginner, intermediate, and expert level participants.\nI signed up immediately and have been going 3 or 4 times a week. Their app lets you know whats available and the rest you do yourself.\nI also signed my mom and sister up and they have really loved it.",

The connected staff, the quality of atmosphere, energy, therapy, structure, organization, balance, safety, empathy, quality food, and commitment taken for each person coming here.\n\nI got treated as a hurt man not a bad man. I was needing a safe place to heal and feel. It is amazing how each man coming in gets a customized treatment plan designed just for the individual.\n\nTo have this for me and others I have seen see this carry over into their Daily lives also through a group healing therapy experience and family healing also.

         "At 64 years old, and after almost 50 years of struggling with the disease of alcohol and drug addiction, “The Ranch” was my first experience ever in any type of treatment. After 60 days of intense, and structured mental, emotional, spiritual , and physical support both “in house”, and outpatient, I experience a “me” that I didn’t realize existed. It’s never too late to heal.....no matter ones age. It’s hard work. And it will continue to be hard work for the rest of our lives. But it’s so much better than the alternatives. As addicts, or loved ones of addicts, we’re well aware of what the alternatives are. The Ranch isn’t your “boiler plate” treatment facility. It’s a safe, sacred place. They genuinely care about, and love their clients. It’s intense. But the staff insisted that we had fun, and enjoyed life. Hiking, softball, fishing, bowling, pizza parties, pool parties, and cookouts were just a few of the activities we regularly enjoyed. The “Brotherhood” that’s created amongst the clients is an experience like no other. A love that’s manifested deep inside the heart exists. We learn to love each other, and at the same time, love ourselves. We ARE our Brothers keeper. We love and support each other long after we leave the Ranch. The hard work pays  off. But one has to be ready to heal in order to reap the benefits of being sober. It’s a good life to live. Peace and serenity are not out of reach. I’ll always be grateful for, and love the Ranch, and everyone associated with the Ranch.They saved my life. God bless all of them.......especially the only friend I had left on the earth that cared enough about me to take me to them. If you’re a loved one of a struggling addict, be “that friend”.",

I look forward to our weekly recovery group meetings.  Learning about addiction and all the ways that it not only affects the addict, but also those that love the addict has been invaluable to me.

Also, they allow loved ones to go to classes that help them with their issues too. Addiction is not a one person problem, it’s a family problem. There is hope in healing families and together we can get better. Just because someone doesn’t drink or use substances doesn’t mean they don’t have issues. Everyone can benefit from this program, I am so grateful for it and my continuing  gratitude will always be to the people that are making this happen.
