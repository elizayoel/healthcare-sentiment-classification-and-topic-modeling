         "We had been taking our pets (3 dogs) to Olin on White Bear Ave for 6+ years. When it came time to put my first pet Freddie down, it took them over an hour to do it. They gave her a shot in her back and said that she would fall asleep but it didn’t work. They gave her a second shot in her back and that still didn’t make her fall asleep. As she struggled to crawl on the floor into Jim’s lap, licking his face for him to pick her up and take her out of there. 3 techs had to hold her down on the floor to give her the 3rd shot which was in her arm. After the 4th shot -they told us they were surprised that she had a very healthy strong heart. In the same sentence they explained that I made the right decision. My baby girl couldn't walk at all and she fought hard to get out of that room. Then once my baby girl left us, they said it normally would take 30 seconds and that I was lucky it took over an hour. We were in shock and disgust at what had just happened. When I went to pick up her remains, they told me I was picking up the wrong dog. They said \"his name is Frankie\" and explained that \"I must be confused as to which dog I was picking up\". MY GOD- are you kidding me? Needless to say it was a traumatic experience not only to put down my baby girl but then to be told \"I was confused...”  Let’s just say, I will not set another foot in that place. When my 2nd dog had a stroke it was time to put her down. I decided to take my sweetheart to Maryland Ave. Pet Hospital.  The experience was still a difficult one.… yet better than the first. Maryland Ave. didn’t stick two needles in her back and watch her try to walk around the room. They gave her one shot of medicine in her arm, within seconds my sweetheart was snoring on the table. I was able to listen to her snore before she left us. We are forever grateful to Maryland Ave Pet Hospital for making this a much better experience than the first -THANK YOU -Maryland Ave Pet Hospital!",

I will definitely be a returning customer!\n\n...\n\nSadly not what it used to be. I haven’t been to Lunchbox in a while but I don’t know that I’ll be back. The esthetician was a very nice girl and held good conversation but her skills could use some improvement. I went home with SO much breakage and missed spots. I know, breakage happens with every visit but I’ve never experienced this much in all my Brazilian waxes over the years. I feel like she didn’t take the time to ensure the leftover hairs were taken care of and I just spent over an hour with a flashlight, mirror, and tweezers cleaning up my lady parts. Definitely not happy about spending $58 (before tip) just to have to remove what was left behind. Probably my own fault for not checking the work before I left, but I assumed I was dealing with professional waxers and didn’t think about it. Maybe a different esthetician would be better? Either way, I’m now very wary about giving them my business.",

I have taken all my pets there for years I even drove from northern ky one a week for my dog to receive baths due to a skin condition that she had for 6 months.  I paid an emergency fee so I could get my one baby spayed there so I knew she would be taken care of.  they are very caring people.  My complaint about them is I recently had to have surgery done on my baby's mouth for cyst that came up.  I called them to get the total so I could get cash to pay for it well my bank was across the street and it was kinda busy that day so when I passed it up I just figured I would write a check, when I got there I again asked what my total was it was the same amount as they quoted before.  I got my baby went to check out and again given the same price as I was quoted twice before.  Months later I get a call saying I owe them $43 dollars.  I asked why the waited so long to contact me and they said the letter they sent out was returned since I had moved but yet they still never called me about it until now.  I do not see how they can come back months later to say I owe this when they gave me the same price 3 times.  Now they want to say they will report it to my credit if I don't pay something on it.  I just got my credit cleared up yes I know I can make payments to them to pay it but at the same time its the principal of it",

Called first to make sure of the weight limit because I'm a pretty healthy girl lol. Customer service is always important to me so that first interaction had to be perfection. Sure enough they were extremely nice and helpful over the phone (1 Star). We finally arrived at the location and low and behold parking was easy as pie (2 Stars). Get the front door and was greeted RIGHT AWAY (3 Stars). Listen guys. How you are greeted when you walk into any company is going to set the pace for how they treat you moving forward. I was amazed at how big and colorful the place was. I got a little bit of butterflies in my stomach seeing people what looked to be 50ft in the air ( not really)  lol. I'm afraid of heights so this placed seemed like it could help me conquer my fears. We were told right away to sign a form. You know they just want to make sure if I crack my skull they are not responsible :) no big deal right? RIGHT! We then were told to look around and come back when we were ready for the small classes to help us new comers. I walked around a bit and I was greeted with smiles from the members of the gym. A guy even asked me if it looks fun. (he was sooo cute) I told him yes and then he asked me If I was single. HAHA ..okay I'm kidding.. he asked if it was my first time there. I told him yes and he wished me luck. Me and my friend then proceeded to take our small class on safety and all that good stuff. When done Lauren showed us how to put the harness on. The first one she gave me didn't fit so she brought me another one. She told us that if we had any other questions to stop by the desk and she would be more the willing to help. We got to the wall and I had my best friend go first lol. She did pretty good. I went next and I actually did pretty good. Neither one of us made it to the top lol. We had like 5 different people encouraging us on how to slid down and to not be afraid. The fact that they were members of the gym was mind blowing to me. This one guy spent most of our time there helping us and using the belay (I think that's what its called). A gym that EVERYONE is helpful at is a plus for me(4 Stars). We called it quits after a little over an hour. Talk about a sore body gesshh! I love the gym and wanted to invest in a membership but was told to go on Groupon to get it 50% off for the first 6 weeks. They didn't have to tell us that part but they did and I appreciate it. I will for sure be back which bring me to the reason I give this place 5 STARS!",

         "I have suffered from chronic pain for nearly a decade now. The pain began after I had my first child, and over the years, as well as after subsequent children, new areas of pain began to surface. I have been to every traditional doctor you can imagine, my PCP, pain specialists, and even physical therapists. Despite the many x-rays, MRI's, and all of the blood work, perscription pain killers and pain injections, my pain never was relieved and no source of pain could be identified. My PCP began telling me that my pain was simply psycho-semantic.\n\nBut clearly my pain was coming from somewhere, my shoulders pop and grind as they move, loud enough for others to look at me wildly and wonder if I am alright; my hips and knees do the same. I even went to other chiropractors to try and find some relief. While I did find some very temporary relief from treatments from the other chiropractors, nothing was long lasting and eventually I wanted to find the real source of pain. No matter what kind of testing was done, no one could find why I was in so much pain.\n\nFinally, I gave up and figured I would just learn to live with my pain, after all maybe it really was psycho-semantic! Then, I became pregnant with my fourth baby, and the pain became unbearable. I would wake up in the morning and my hands would be so numb that I would have to run hot water over them just to get any sensation back, my grip started to go, and I had no idea what to do. That's when I found Dr. Myshka.\n\nIn just three adjustments, my pregnancy related carpel tunnel was gone. My headaches disappeared, and I found energy I haven't had in years. The reason Dr. Myshka works when other chiropractors didn't is because he uses the Gonstead system, and he has 30+ years of experience.\n\nI knew after my first consultation that Dr. Myshka was different than any other chiropractor I have ever seen. His tools are different, his methods are different, and his naked eye spotted every single thing that other doctors told me were wrong through x-ray testing and MRI's without me saying a word to him about it, and then he also found more.\n\nNot only did Dr. Myshka spot everything structurally wrong with my spine, but he noticed vitamin deficiencies, recommended new sleeping positions, and every little bit of information he has given me has made a huge difference in the quality of my daily life. I was resigned to the fact that I would suffer from pain for the rest of my life, but in less than a week, Dr. Myshka has proven to me that with regular adjustments, good vitamins, good food, and changes to my posture, I can minimize my pain and prevent any further injuries.\n\nI was praying for a doctor that would see me as a whole human being, and not just another source of income. Dr. Myshka is the answer to my prayers, and I am so thankful that we have him in the N.W.A. area! Thanks Doctor, and please don't ever leave!",

I have been extremely impressed with Dr Howell and his staff!  If dentistry had half the things he does when I was younger, I don't think I would have been so afraid of the dentist!

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

I had mine done and had to ask what my results were and the hygienist didn’t even bother to look until I asked. She only took a quick look. Overall, I did not feel appreciated nor valued as a customer. I hope their service improves...",

Not knowing how much glasses typically cost, I called my mom about the pricing and she was in shock. She immediately told me to leave and being that she has worn glasses since her 20's, I believed her and didn't purchase glasses. After inputting my subscription into multiple websites to find a pair that do what I need, I'm ending today with two new pairs of glasses (with my Prism lenses) for $60 total, after shipping. Again, I think the staff is friendly, but I do think they charge a lot and had I not had my mom to tell me otherwise, I would've paid that much. Not saying don't go here, but do your research on pricing before choosing to buy from them or not. I'm sure the quality is great, but at the end of the day, glasses shouldn't cost $800 unless they match my Louis Vuitton purse, which they didn't.",

         "Personally, I felt that this place benefited me more than any other hospital I've been to. However, I'd like to mention the lack of hygiene in this place. There's a laundry room but .. no .. detergent? That's just asking for mold to grow on our clothes. Next up, the building itself. It feels grimy, and could really use some fixing.\n\nThe bed sheets are not changed regularly and patients are forced to change them themselves. Staff should be the ones required doing this. Guardians pay good money to have their children admitted here.\n\nThe food here isn't too bad. I wasn't particularly fond of it.\nThey serve snacks here too, such as animal crackers, cheese its, and chips. Though, I'd like to mention that what's served at lunch and dinner isn't particularly enough. Also, I'd like to see better choices for snacks. A hydrated snack such as peaches, apples, bananas, oranges, or watermelon slices. The better kids eat, the happier and healthier they will be- so please take that in to consideration!\n\nAlso, I really need to see improvements on the hygiene in this place. That's a major factor.\n\nPhysical health correlates with mental health, such as eating habits and hydration. I think that fresh, cold water should be served rather than faucet water. Bed sheets should be changed every two to three days. Blankets should be thick enough as to keep patients warm (let's face it, it's hard to sleep when you're freezing). Laundry should be checked daily for children who're running low on things to wear. Detergent should be used with every clothing/bedsheet wash. Snacks should consist of more than dry foods, and healthier foods such as carrots, apples, peaches, oranges, or watermelon. Maybe even banana.\n\nHygiene products should be given every night. I'd suggest having small bottles of shampoo and conditioner (body wash, too) for every night. When the children are done, they turn them in. Simple.\n\nThey don't check in frequently enough to make sure every patient has enough hygiene products. I didn't get a hairbrush until later in my stay!\n\nAlso, ladies, they have like an endless supply of pads. No bloods stains, lol!\n\nNow, here are the things I love about this place!\n\nI thought the staff were very friendly compared to these other reviews. This place was my first stay at a hospital, and honestly, if I had to go to another one, I'd go here. They focus on treatment and the mental well being of everyone. Though, there /are/ frequent fights, I usually see them broken up quickly by the staff.\n\nThey have a TV lounge that's comfortable, they offer art supplies, and you aren't forced to do schoolwork here. Sometimes you really need to have a mental break, and I'm glad they understand that. At such a state, I couldn't get myself to work- but they understood that. They made me feel at home.\n\nTheir gym is super fun. They've got basketball goals, and you don't even have to participate! Though, I think you should if you're staying. It's fun. Esteem boost? YES!\n\nThey separate genders. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"Omg, this is just like school\".\n\nNo. They do this to ensure the safety of children and to prevent any unwanted sexual assault. Sure, it's still possible, but the likelihood is greatly decreased this way.\n\nTheir playground is super fun. Like, I mean SUPER. I connected with a lot of girls here and we had a good time. Of course, in a place like this all friends are temporary, but that's aside the point. I felt socially connected and happy.\n\nKIDS AREN'T TREATED LIKE THUGS HERE.\n\nIf you've been to other hospitals, you've probably seen multiple floor levels depending on the /reason/ they're there. At Methodist, all children are treated with an equal amount of respect and love. It makes me so happy.\n\nThis is honestly the place to go if your child is suicidal.\nPlease work on the hygiene issues in this place though. Other than that, I love it. My stay was actually three years ago, and I'm sure this place hasn't changed!",

         "This is my story, my information, my thoughts and experiences.\nI am a previous acute wing patient. I was seventeen at the time and my  psychiatrist recommended my mother put me in inpatient treatment. I am manic depressant, bipolar and often struggle with social anxiety. Not once have I ever cut myself, took medication to feel \"high\" nor have I done any street drugs. I was so depressed to where I would wake up feeling \"dead\". I also have/had night terrors. Depression literally kills you, it gets you down and you don't wanna make an effort to move forward. Yet, I wasn't harming myself or anyone else. I begged my mother to not check me in and to let me go to  counseling, but she didn't ever budge. I had a session with the lady at the front desk, and she assured me that the doctor makes the decision to be checked in or not, not my parent(s) or I, myself. I sat by myself for a long time, I cried and cried to the point of making myself physically sick. The woman then brought me dinner, keep in mind this is at roughly 5:00 - 7:00 p.m. That's when she told me I was being admitted. That's when I broke. The one thing I never wanted to happen, was happening. I felt like my whole world was crumbling down. My mother and I then had to leave and meet up with another woman who works the night shift on that wing. She asked me a series of questions which involved nightmares, medications, sexual behaviors, etc. My mother answered every single question, because I couldn't speak for myself at that point. Then, I was asked to be strip searched, cough and squat as well, just like any other facility. Then I said goodbye.\n\nI sat down for what seemed like hours to only cry by myself until one of the guys my age offered me something to drink and a snack. The facility only serves healthy snacks and drinks. The lobby or common area serves water all day long. When snack time rolls around you get offered juices and milks. If you're like me, they have you on a Non-Concentrated Sugars Diet (NCS.) It's honestly not as bad as it sounds. You get a lot of fruit, while other kids may get offered cookies or crackers. The only other restriction on food there is Finger Foods (FF.) You'll only get FF if you could possibly harm yourself or others at that time with a plastic utensil.\n\nYou'll be asked several times a day how you're feeling. If you feel suicidal or feel like harming others. When you're angry or upset, you can pace back and forth up and down the halls, but only after you've received permission. Otherwise, you can get yourself into a lot of unnecessary trouble.\n\nIn the mornings after breakfast and after dinner and medication they have Hygiene time. You'll get this plastic box with your name on it. It'll come with a  disposable toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, lotion, a bar of soap, and body wash/shampoo. Ask your parents or guardians to bring you your own shampoo & conditioner. I left with my hair being very brittle, breaking off and even falling out.\n\nYou're allowed two and most times just one towel and a wash cloth when requested. You must take them out and put them in the laundry closet after you've showered. It's considered  contraband if left inside you and your roommates room.\nGIRLS ONLY\nYou can't have a box of tampons, pads or wire bras. It's another form of contraband.\n\nContraband includes:\nShoelaces\nJewelry\nMakeup (optional on different \"levels\")\nBoxes of femine items\nStrings\nHoodies\nYoga pants or anything form fitting. Just pack baggy clothes to be safe. Jeans are allowed though.\n\nSchool;\nThere's a good chance you'll be split into teams, such as A & B.  The A-Team will go to class in the morning and B will go in te afternoon.  You'll line up by the front door and count.  Ladies first, the first will say one, then two and so on. After the girls are finished counting the boys will continue the count with the number the girls left off of.\n\nActivities;\nYou and your wing's behavior decides whether you get to participate in activities or not. If one person ruins it, it's all over. You may get to go outside to play on the playground.",

         "I've decided to share this review now having experienced very different treatment by front staff at both the Fayetteville and Fort Smith clinics.\n\nI took my daughter to the Fayetteville location to have her 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Sarna. There I found the staff to be personable, caring, thorough and compassionate. Dr. Sarna is the best! Very personable, compassionate, with a winning personality that was quick to put both my daughter and I at ease. The procedure was flawless and her recovery was quick and relatively painless!\n\nNow onto my recent experience with the Fort Smith clinic, where 6 days ago, I had to have all of my bottom teeth removed, under local anesthesia. There was a lot of back and forth with this location, as I'd had to reschedule multiple times (life happens, unfortunately not like we plan). I found the staff here to be rude, at times dishonest, and overall difficult to work with. To be perfectly honest, were there other choices in this immediate area, I'd have probably moved on and had the work done elsewhere.\n\nWhen I got to the clinic one thing I noticed upon arrival is their avoidance to turn your direction or look you in the eyes. They weren't overly rude in person, but they didn't go out of their way to be kind either.\n\nOnce I got to the back, the young lady (I'm sorry I didn't get her name) who was assisting Dr. Sarna, was kind and considerate. When I started to cough, she immediately got me a bottle of water, came in and checked on me several times as we waited for the good doctor (he was busy with other procedures as he simultaneously prepared me for mine), asked me appropriate questions, and let me know she was there if I needed anything.\n\nUpfront I should say that in the past, I have had very bad experiences with dentists and I have a fear of them, as well as having anything done in my mouth. Having all of my teeth removed was scary and I was a nervous wreck! But Dr. Sarna was very kind, talked to me throughout the procedure, made sure I was completely numb before he started, and was extremely quick in getting all fractured teeth removed (he timed it at 5 minutes total). If I was basing my review and it's stars on his treatment alone, I would give 5 stars easily. He is an asset to his profession and I would recommend him to anyone. Unfortunately, I had to deal with some nonsense with some of his staff and that taints my overall experience.\n\nSomeone from the clinic called me 2 days after the procedure to check on me, which I appreciated.",
