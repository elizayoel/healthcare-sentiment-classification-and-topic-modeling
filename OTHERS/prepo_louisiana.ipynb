She simply quoted her standard, Medicare, \"book, chapter and verse\" to me, because Medicare had provided me a mobility scooter (which lives in my car for use outside the home  because i am unable to get it into, or out OF, the house)... despite me telling her in detail what medicare told me, and that medicare said that I was correct in believing that I was qualified for a new manual chair because of its age (6 years).\n\nSHE said, that SHE didn't know WHY MEDICARE would have TOLD me that.  Ummmmmmmm... MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE MEDICARE!?!?!?\n\nShe says she discussed the issue of my claim with her manager... and within an hour called me back to say that she \"couldn't write the claim for this chair.\"\n\nDid she BOTHER to CALL MEDICARE to VERIFY the veracity of my claim?  Did ANYONE CALL Medicare to check my account for the RECORD of my lengthy conversation with them, wherein they explained WHY the claim would be honored?  Evidently NOT. They couldn't be bothered to verify my statement? Make one call?\n\nFrom where I sit, a 50 YO paraplegic in a rotting, creaky, decrepit chair--- they don't appear inclined to go the extra mile for a potential new client.  I have many, many, medical equipment needs, but I'll send to TEXAS, before I buy anything from these people.  What if it was one of their friends or family (God forbid)?\n\nEver so helpful, she gleefully chirped that she'd be HAPPY to sell me a USED (\"It's almost like NEW!\") manual wheelchair... for SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN dollars, and twenty cents.  I wonder if she actually heard herself SAY that?\n\nMedicare. Disability. #duh.  Just. wow.",

I have had pets misdiagnosed, they have run out of medicine when my dog was being treated for a life threatening case of Blastomycosis, I have had a vet refuse to come back to answer a question, I have had a vet there try to give my dog a med that was contraindicated for her .This was the last straw. I have been a client there for 23 years. Dr Betty used to own the clinic and it was fantastic but now I will never go back after the way I was treated.After Katrina, I recommended this clinic to everybody I know that moved to the Northshore. Now I am telling them about my recent bad experience and the are moving on to a different clinic as well.I know other people who are having the same problems so they must be paying their friends to give them 5 star reviews.",

It also stated order online jump the line. So, that’s what I did. I waited a few minutes and took my tractor to a store that did not exist. My order was $15.09 and there is no store but an opened website to receive orders knowing full well the orders will not be honored. With this virus going around it’s very hard to find places to ea and I was floored that this has happened. I’m on a budget and my mom is in a nursing home, I do not have $15.09 to give away without me making that decision too.  I want my money baxk. You know the website is still receiving orders. Why, why, why would you let that happen? Please refund my money or I’m calling the authorities.",

And we still need a p.a. for other. Weeks go by and still no meds.

This pharmacy made my son go without his meds for school for weeks for no reason at all! Simply bc they didnt want to do there damn jobs! And my son suffered!

She simply quoted her standard, Medicare, \"book, chapter and verse\" to me, because Medicare had provided me a mobility scooter (which lives in my car for use outside the home  because i am unable to get it into, or out OF, the house)... despite me telling her in detail what medicare told me, and that medicare said that I was correct in believing that I was qualified for a new manual chair because of its age (6 years).\n\nSHE said, that SHE didn't know WHY MEDICARE would have TOLD me that.  Ummmmmmmm... MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE MEDICARE!?!?!?\n\nShe says she discussed the issue of my claim with her manager... and within an hour called me back to say that she \"couldn't write the claim for this chair.\"\n\nDid she BOTHER to CALL MEDICARE to VERIFY the veracity of my claim?  Did ANYONE CALL Medicare to check my account for the RECORD of my lengthy conversation with them, wherein they explained WHY the claim would be honored?  Evidently NOT. They couldn't be bothered to verify my statement? Make one call?\n\nFrom where I sit, a 50 YO paraplegic in a rotting, creaky, decrepit chair--- they don't appear inclined to go the extra mile for a potential new client.  I have many, many, medical equipment needs, but I'll send to TEXAS, before I buy anything from these people.  What if it was one of their friends or family (God forbid)?\n\nEver so helpful, she gleefully chirped that she'd be HAPPY to sell me a USED (\"It's almost like NEW!\") manual wheelchair... for SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN dollars, and twenty cents.  I wonder if she actually heard herself SAY that?\n\nMedicare. Disability. #duh.  Just. wow.",

I have had pets misdiagnosed, they have run out of medicine when my dog was being treated for a life threatening case of Blastomycosis, I have had a vet refuse to come back to answer a question, I have had a vet there try to give my dog a med that was contraindicated for her .This was the last straw. I have been a client there for 23 years. Dr Betty used to own the clinic and it was fantastic but now I will never go back after the way I was treated.After Katrina, I recommended this clinic to everybody I know that moved to the Northshore. Now I am telling them about my recent bad experience and the are moving on to a different clinic as well.I know other people who are having the same problems so they must be paying their friends to give them 5 star reviews.",

We never received a call at our office about these issues.  Our Christmas light installs should never require a customer to have to add fuses or breakers to your fuse box.  For our lighting jobs we don't have contracts but signed estimates in order to install lights.  If you didn't want us to install any lights, you could've simply called our office and canceled before the install.  We also use shingle tabs to install lights on roofs which would never leave a hole in your roof.\"}",

She simply quoted her standard, Medicare, \"book, chapter and verse\" to me, because Medicare had provided me a mobility scooter (which lives in my car for use outside the home  because i am unable to get it into, or out OF, the house)... despite me telling her in detail what medicare told me, and that medicare said that I was correct in believing that I was qualified for a new manual chair because of its age (6 years).\n\nSHE said, that SHE didn't know WHY MEDICARE would have TOLD me that.  Ummmmmmmm... MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE MEDICARE!?!?!?\n\nShe says she discussed the issue of my claim with her manager... and within an hour called me back to say that she \"couldn't write the claim for this chair.\"\n\nDid she BOTHER to CALL MEDICARE to VERIFY the veracity of my claim?  Did ANYONE CALL Medicare to check my account for the RECORD of my lengthy conversation with them, wherein they explained WHY the claim would be honored?  Evidently NOT. They couldn't be bothered to verify my statement? Make one call?\n\nFrom where I sit, a 50 YO paraplegic in a rotting, creaky, decrepit chair--- they don't appear inclined to go the extra mile for a potential new client.  I have many, many, medical equipment needs, but I'll send to TEXAS, before I buy anything from these people.  What if it was one of their friends or family (God forbid)?\n\nEver so helpful, she gleefully chirped that she'd be HAPPY to sell me a USED (\"It's almost like NEW!\") manual wheelchair... for SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN dollars, and twenty cents.  I wonder if she actually heard herself SAY that?\n\nMedicare. Disability. #duh.  Just. wow.",

How sad is it when your beloved pet passes and the vet who owns the clinic will not even take the time to sign the sympathy card when all of the staff does and when I inquired about that I was told he never signs any of them. I have had pets misdiagnosed, they have run out of medicine when my dog was being treated for a life threatening case of Blastomycosis, I have had a vet refuse to come back to answer a question, I have had a vet there try to give my dog a med that was contraindicated for her .This was the last straw. I have been a client there for 23 years. Dr Betty used to own the clinic and it was fantastic but now I will never go back after the way I was treated.After Katrina, I recommended this clinic to everybody I know that moved to the Northshore. Now I am telling them about my recent bad experience and the are moving on to a different clinic as well.I know other people who are having the same problems so they must be paying their friends to give them 5 star reviews.",

Requested a temporary admission for my daughter until I could get her to a long term treatment facility the next day. The next day they refused to discharge her to an accepting accredited long term facility. She has a roommate that snores loudly making sleep impossible. She was told by a nurse to put two chairs together and sleep on that in the common area. The Doctor and Psychiatrist will not be treating her long term but yet they insisted she stay for more treatment. It’s all about money. They are not there to help anyone. Please never admit your loved one to this place.",

Actually his dad was only dating 3 weeks. I told her it was none if his girlfriend's business. She did not tell me I was on speaker phone until my son spoke up. I later find out from my son that  his dad & girlfriend were in there too. That is unethical. By law they are supposed to tell me I'm on speaker & who is in there listening. I never even met the girlfriend so she had no business listening in on my conversation. I left  message for her supervisor twice & once for her & no one returns my calls.

Unprofessional) He tried to tell them he wasn’t there for drug abuse because the medication he takes is prescribed, one is medicine for a painful physical ailment. They gave him a medicine and it made him so sick. He had to throw a tantrum before they looked up the prescriptions he takes. I even tried calling up there and got the runaround. Twice.

There's some shady and illegal things going on here, including something called \"TPMF\" or True Pop Me Friend, which must be VERY illegal. The premise of a TPMF is that you and another person each have a rubber band on your wrist and both parties pull the rubber band far back, though not to the point that the rubber band breaks. Both then release the band, and after a little while of this, one of the veins in your wrist is revealed and something behind it bursts, which the doctors then proceed to let bleed out. A terrible institution, and I'm surprised it hasn't been shut down. I highly advise against this money vacuum. One star is infinitely more than this place deserves.",

They never contacted my therapist or psychiatrist, which they should have. They had two separate sexual incidents while I was there that the techs did not report, rather bragged and joked about it.

This place has gone to hell in a handbasket. Left early because I was being harassed and the meetings are not monitored. It's like blind leading the blind in the 28 day program. I am doing much better out in the world just doing IOP and AA. Not a good rehab. Too much fighting and arguing and no one does anything about it.
