It takes time to work up to what we do and get comfortable with the routine, so we always recommend that you continue coming back to enhance your skill.

I didn't know how to wrap my hands and they kindly did it for me.  I'm still trying t figure out how to wrap my hands, but the employees there are very patient with me.  They have no problem helping me out.  When the class started I was nervous that I would be behind.  Again, the worries went away.  The instructors were amazing and also patient.  If I my form was off, they'd come by and show me.  After that first class, I didn't even hesitate to become a member of the Title Boxing Club family.  The price is a bit steep, but in my opinion it is worth it.  The facility is clean and organized.  I would recommend this to a friend and I recommend it to you.  The instructors are funny, energetic, patient, kind and very talented.  If you are considering joining a boxing club or facility I recommend this one.  Though the price is a bit steep, it is better than others I've looked at for sure.",

         "I was delighted to find a boxing/kickboxing gym in this part of Baltimore County as it was previously unavailable.  Compared to other martial arts studios in the area the classes are much more flexible and affordable. The gym facility is always clean and inviting.  The coaches and front desk staff are all very welcoming, nice and knowledgable.  The coaches let you work at your own pace while encouraging you to take it to the next level and cater to all skill levels. The classes run throughout the whole day so theres a time slot convenient for everyone.  They provide gloves for those just starting out so you dont have to invest before you decide to join ( but you will). The workout you will get here is incredible stress relief and will make you want to come back day after day. And overall they make it really easy for you to come out, have a good experience, and make sure you're comfortable and having fun.\n\nBefore joining title I was not active at all.  Since joining in April I've consistently come back day after day because the community here is so encouraging and provides a sense of accountability.  It's not just a gym that you'll walk into, workout,  and leave without anyone noticing.\n\nYou'll come for the workout and stay for the community.  If you're considering it, come out and try a class and you'll know what everyone is raving about.   Joining this gym was one of the best decisions I've made this year and I cant wait to continue to see the positive mental and physical changes these workouts provide for me.",
