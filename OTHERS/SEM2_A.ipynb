         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak.

         "This place is a complete JOKE!!!! I have been there 3 times. The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak.

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

         "I am a new patient with Dr. Salathe, although I've know her for some time as my own client.  I am a personal trainer, nutritionist and CrossFit trainer, so health and fitness are what I do.  I've been a trainer for about 20 years and advocate for holistic health to all of my clients.  As I got to know Dr. Salathe, it became clearly evident that she was very intelligent, but most importantly that she CARED for her patients. Our conversations (in between burpees and sit-ups) centered around her philosophy of preventative care and education.  She believes in caring for her patients before matters get out of hand.  So, knowing this about her, I decided to leave my dentist of 10 years and give her a whirl.\n\nUpon entering the office, you are immediately greeted by a warm, friendly face.  Dr. Salathe came out to give me a hug and greet her other patients.  Um...I've never known a dentist to come out to the waiting room and hug her patients.  My 8 year old son was with me and was immediately intrigued by the \"Salathe Smile Points\" poster.  He told me I needed to acquire 100 points because he wanted a prize- lol!\n\nNext, I was led back and met my hygienist, Rachel.  Rachel did one of the most thorough cleanings I have ever had (it made me ponder why I stayed with the other practice for so long).  She did a full set of x-rays and did a 3D imaging of my jaw to look for any anomalies (my previous dentist did not have this technology).  Dr. Salathe came in and did my exam, all the while asking questions and providing education.  She even took the time to show my 8 year old my mouth and different things she was looking at.  After the exam, Dr. Salathe and Rachel, introduced me to the WaterPic flossing system and even told me where it was on sale (Costco- BEST THING EVER!).\n\nWhat stands out for me, is the education.  I have always been told, \"oh, your teeth are so pretty,\" which I always found odd.  I'm not the flosser I should be, so it was strange to always be told how great things were.  Rachel told me I had gingivitis, that I needed to work on specific things, that I needed a night guard to help with a chipping tooth, that I need to get my chipped tooth sealed (my other dentist told me to just watch it and unless it hurt I shouldn't do anything) and that to my sons chagrin I wouldn't get the 100 points he was hoping for!\n\nBottom line, as a health care advocate myself, I don't need a practice that sugar-coats things for me.  I need a dentist who is honest with me and truly believes in my health, so much so that they are willing to tell me the honest truth.  I will never go anywhere again and yes, my son, is now going to be a patient of Dr. Salathe (and he is convincing my 10 year old daughter that this is the place to be!).",

         "Fort Mill Prep- a preschool with true heart!  I was a stay at home mom for 7 years, and when I chose to return to the workforce, one of my big concerns was finding a daycare that would provide an enriching, nurturing, and caring environment where my children could blossom  and still experience the best of childhood.  I did not want my children in an antiseptic, institutionalized environment where I felt they were just cogs in a corporate daycare.  I toured many daycares/preschools in the area and was very disappointed until I found Fort Mill Preparatory School.  The moment I walked onto Fort Mill Prep's campus and toured the cozy, inviting classrooms, I knew I had found the perfect school for my children.   The classrooms are stocked with they type of toys that promote and encourage hours of open-ended imaginative play.  The entire room is designed around inspiring creativity, learning and imagination in ways that engage all the children's senses.  The curriculum is play-based, hands-on learning that is fun and effective.  The children are not only learning, but they are connected to the natural world through the many animals on site.  There are chickens, and a miniature horse (and some others) outside, a Frog tank in the lobby, and my child has a bearded dragon in his classroom.  Not only do the children get to observe the animals and learn to appreciate the environment, but they learn responsibility as well.  This school also has a stellar nutrition program when all children are fed fresh foods made right on site.  Everything is homemade, the children are not fed any processed junk, and there is an emphasis on clean eating and lots of healthy fruits and vegetables.  Their food program has really expanded my child's palate and he now eats foods he wouldn't even try at home, because he sees all of his friends enjoying the healthy meals.   I also cannot say enough good things about the staff, they are all so professional and kind.  There is also very little staff turnover at this school, especially compared to other daycares in the area.  The dedication of the staff to the school and its mission tells you a lot about the type of education and care your child will receive, which is only top notch at Fort Mill prep.",

         "Fort Mill Prep- a preschool with true heart!  I was a stay at home mom for 7 years, and when I chose to return to the workforce, one of my big concerns was finding a daycare that would provide an enriching, nurturing, and caring environment where my children could blossom  and still experience the best of childhood.  I did not want my children in an antiseptic, institutionalized environment where I felt they were just cogs in a corporate daycare.  I toured many daycares/preschools in the area and was very disappointed until I found Fort Mill Preparatory School.  The moment I walked onto Fort Mill Prep's campus and toured the cozy, inviting classrooms, I knew I had found the perfect school for my children.   The classrooms are stocked with they type of toys that promote and encourage hours of open-ended imaginative play.  The entire room is designed around inspiring creativity, learning and imagination in ways that engage all the children's senses.  The curriculum is play-based, hands-on learning that is fun and effective.  The children are not only learning, but they are connected to the natural world through the many animals on site.  There are chickens, and a miniature horse (and some others) outside, a Frog tank in the lobby, and my child has a bearded dragon in his classroom.  Not only do the children get to observe the animals and learn to appreciate the environment, but they learn responsibility as well.  This school also has a stellar nutrition program when all children are fed fresh foods made right on site.  Everything is homemade, the children are not fed any processed junk, and there is an emphasis on clean eating and lots of healthy fruits and vegetables.  Their food program has really expanded my child's palate and he now eats foods he wouldn't even try at home, because he sees all of his friends enjoying the healthy meals.   I also cannot say enough good things about the staff, they are all so professional and kind.  There is also very little staff turnover at this school, especially compared to other daycares in the area.  The dedication of the staff to the school and its mission tells you a lot about the type of education and care your child will receive, which is only top notch at Fort Mill prep.",

         "It’s hard to nail down one specific thing about The Club by George Foreman III that makes it such an amazing and unique gym.  The space. The people. The vibe.  The whole package really makes this place over-the-top.  The Club is a gym for everyone, no matter your fitness level, age, or goals. Everyone who steps in the door is treated with respect and welcomed as a member of the family.  It is definitely not a gym of posers or meatheads, but that's not to say that there aren't lots of people who are serious about fitness....there certainly are, but it is not an intimidating atmosphere at all.   It really says something when you often find several middle-age women on the weight floor or boxing right next to 20yr guys.\nYes, boxing is a focus here, but it is far from a typical boxing gym. You can be a seasoned boxer, or a complete newbie (like the majority of members are).   The focal point of the zillions of classes they offer is a terrific workout call “Box-FIIT”.  It’s a 45 minute, whole body, 10-12 station group circuit class that combines, strength, cardio, and boxing elements, all timed through the big boxing clock on the wall.  The class is typically filled with a broad range of people, different ages, backgrounds, fitness levels, yet everyone is working together, getting a great workout in, and having a blast while sweating away.\nIn addition to Box-FIIT, there is a huge variety of classes to suit almost every person and goal.  In addition to indoor cycling, yoga and pilates, barre, and the most ridiculous core class you’ve ever attempted (Dave Bergeron’s Fighter’s Core), there are boxing focused classes (for all ability levels) that combine boxing technique with cadio, core and even dance.  All the classes are fun and intense and incredible workouts.\nGeorge, AJ, and Dave have assembled a great team of trainers who are incredibly dedicated and professional, yet approachable and personable.  They are always available to answer questions or give advice, and they take such a personal vested interest in all members. It doesn't matter who you are, what you do at the gym, or how in shape you are (or aren't), everyone who comes in the door is welcomed sincerely.  Usually within a few visits, they great you by name. This sort of atmosphere does wonders for making members feel like The Club is a place they want to come to and be part of.\n\nI cannot recommend The Club more highly.  Give them a try...you won't regret it.",

Upon me about to walk up to the desk a receptionist yells out HE GOT A VIP PASS THATS WHY HE SKIPPED YOU. I never got a chance to ask. That upset me because she assumed what I wanted to ask. We passed some words nothing threatening I guess she told the Manager Mike. And he told me because I didn’t talk to him and I went about the situation the way I did I have been permanently deferred. So, I guess you can’t asks questions or they’ll kick you out.",

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

         "Please do not let your U of A student go to this clinic!!!  My daughter went there her Freshman year 2 days in a row. The first day they told her she had a cold.  She went back the next day with a high fever, and was told that her white blood cells were elevated,  but they didn’t know where the infection was so they gave her a general antibiotic and told her to rest. Luckily her sister was in town that night and stopped in to see her.  She took her to the emergency room because she was concerned.  Long story short, we spent the next 29 days in the hospital fighting bacterial meningitis!  And after all that, they sent us a bill for their service!  Had to pay because they will hold your grades, and you have to turn in your grades by a certain date to keep your scholarship!  1 Star is too high for this place, but you can’t leave a review without giving them that!",

         "This place is a complete JOKE!!!! I have been there 3 times. The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative.

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

I asked the receptionist if I really needed the full 30 minutes to fill out paperwork to which her response was \"I don't know if you're capable of that or not.\" She offered to reschedule for the next available appointment, even though there was not another soul in the waiting room.

The phlebotomist did a good job- he drew 5+ vials of blood and I barely felt it since he did a pretty good job making chit chat to distract me. My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill.

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday.

I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",
