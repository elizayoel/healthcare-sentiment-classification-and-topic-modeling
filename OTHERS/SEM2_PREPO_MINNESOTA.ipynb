I wasn’t sure how long I needed a 10x30 and they made me feel right at home with what I needed.  Whether it was 60 days or 6 years.  Showed me options, let me measure, let me use my own lock, and had me signed up and out the door in 15 minutes.  Safe, secure, easy keypad, easy to pay in person or online.  Easy easy easy and convienent.  Would recommend them to anyone over the big name overpriced popular places that flood your search engine.  Thank you guys !",

He is very knowledgeable in all areas. He was able to work around our schedule and very flexible.  Matt pays extreme attention to detail and is a perfectionist. He had a lot of good ideas in order to stay within our budget. I couldn't be any happier with how this kitchen turned out. Thank you Matt and your team for all your hard work, it looks amazing!! We would definitely use MDR for future projects, can't wait for a new bathroom next.\n\nSincerely\nNadine &Aj",

Then mudroom replacement light, bathroom faucet re-install, and new bathroom floor tile and new baseboard installation.

I wasn’t sure how long I needed a 10x30 and they made me feel right at home with what I needed.  Whether it was 60 days or 6 years.  Showed me options, let me measure, let me use my own lock, and had me signed up and out the door in 15 minutes.  Safe, secure, easy keypad, easy to pay in person or online.  Easy easy easy and convienent.  Would recommend them to anyone over the big name overpriced popular places that flood your search engine.  Thank you guys !",

He is very knowledgeable in all areas. He was able to work around our schedule and very flexible.  Matt pays extreme attention to detail and is a perfectionist. He had a lot of good ideas in order to stay within our budget. I couldn't be any happier with how this kitchen turned out. Thank you Matt and your team for all your hard work, it looks amazing!!

Next came a electrical outlet for a water softener that was installed previously.  Then mudroom replacement light, bathroom faucet re-install, and new bathroom floor tile and new baseboard installation.

Matt's company website came up and on it said \"no job to small\". I knew if it was on the BBB website and he wasn't afraid of doing small jobs, even though he does big remodeling jobs, that was someone I could work with.\nMatt responded back quickly and we started off with a kitchen sink and disposal replacement. Next came a electrical outlet for a water softener that was installed previously.  Then mudroom replacement light, bathroom faucet re-install, and new bathroom floor tile and new baseboard installation. It's all professionally done and reasonably priced!\nMatt is so very easy to work with, honest, and very detailed. I would recommend him and will continue to use his company for future projects.",

Matt's company website came up and on it said \"no job to small\". I knew if it was on the BBB website and he wasn't afraid of doing small jobs, even though he does big remodeling jobs, that was someone I could work with.\nMatt responded back quickly and we started off with a kitchen sink and disposal replacement. Next came a electrical outlet for a water softener that was installed previously.  Then mudroom replacement light, bathroom faucet re-install, and new bathroom floor tile and new baseboard installation. It's all professionally done and reasonably priced!\nMatt is so very easy to work with, honest, and very detailed. I would recommend him and will continue to use his company for future projects.",

When I was picking out glasses after my most recent exam, I was not informed of any anti-glare options (whereas I did choose that option before); I guess it's my fault for not asking about this. Picked up my new glasses today and there are purple halos/reflections around any light source - makes it very hard to see clearly, especially when looking at a computer screen or driving when it's sunny. I call the office regarding the possibility of fixing this and they connect me with an optometrist; he assures me that if I come in again they will fix it. I drive across town (again), and when I get there the man at the back counter tells me actually there is nothing they can do and I am stuck with these glasses, and that I was not allowed to pay out of pocket to fix it either. Finally the issue was agreed upon to be fixed with an out of pocket payment on my 3rd visit in the same day. Your staff need to have better communication with each other - it was extremely frustrating to be told different things by different staff members. Also when ordering glasses for customers your staff need to explain the available options better, even if those options lead to out-of-pocket costs. Thank you for understanding my frustration, not to mention my wasted time and gas money.\n\nEdit - When I got my glasses back after paying $120 out of pocket for them to be fixed (I wanted the huge purple reflections removed so I could see) the glasses were returned to me in exactly the same condition, with nothing noticeable done to them. I guess I wouldn't expect anything different. Changing the review from 2 stars to 1 to reflect the quality of service I received.",

She is a great listener & willingly goes the extra mile to provide superior care.\n\n”Diane” is a contact lens whiz! I was having issues with lens placement and removal. She observed me and spent time giving me pointers. I would also like to make special mention to “Becky” (front office), and Dr. Marsac. They came to the rescue on a Saturday when I had a stuck contact lens. They quickly took care of the issue even though I didn’t have an appointment.

         "I can review Andrew Residence as a resident and a former employee.  While for some it is a wonderful experience; they plan to live their till they die.  It all depends on your treatment by staff.  As an employee, I was falsely accused by them and went 8 years without a regular paycheck after due to this until someone said I could sue.  Some Do No Right residents are casually slandered to all new employees--and there is huge turnover--so they are in a constant state of abuse.  You wouldn't believe me if I listed it so I won't.  And it's not my mental illness.  The inequity \"class\" system where some are driven to restaurants/stores needlessly because they come from wealthy families, and others are made to ride bus after bus with heavy loads and bruised ribs.  My resume was vandalized for the final time--I give up after they made it so staff have to open flash drives and the worker messed up my resume.  I have not eaten in the diningroom there for 4 years due to abuse/complaint/retaliation repeated over and over culminating in a horrific event.  I wrote everyone including the White House for help and haven't received any.  Champion hope?  Life is hopeless.  Guided by ethics?  The libel in the official records they write which look so professional is laughable fiction.  They've sabotaged my efforts.  I worked  there 2 years; lived there 13 1/2 years and seen so much injustice in my \"world.\"  Live here till I die?  I have no where to go, so yes.  They'll get their Do No Wrong content residents to tell you about the prime rib/shrimp/steak 7 course meals in the diningroom I can only dream of.  Life is unlivable; Christ is returning soon.  Hope this is the End Time.",
