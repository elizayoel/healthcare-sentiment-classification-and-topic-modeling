I get a call THE EVENING BEFORE  her appointment telling me that we will need to reschedule the appointment due to them forgetting to order what they need for her fitting.\nWhen I called to see if there was anything I could do to get my daughter in and quite honestly completely confused as to why the appointment was even made for that day in the first place or at the the very least why they waited until the night before to notify me of them canceling the appointment I was met with extremely rude and unprofessional staff",

My husband had to schedule and pay his assistant to come in to work  so he can leave early to pick the children up from daycare.  Then....  I get a call THE EVENING BEFORE  her appointment telling me that we will need to reschedule the appointment due to them forgetting to order what they need for her fitting.\nWhen I called to see if there was anything I could do to get my daughter in and quite honestly completely confused as to why the appointment was even made for that day in the first place or at the the very least why they waited until the night before to notify me of them canceling the appointment I was met with extremely rude and unprofessional staff",

My husband had to schedule and pay his assistant to come in to work  so he can leave early to pick the children up from daycare.  Then....  I get a call THE EVENING BEFORE  her appointment telling me that we will need to reschedule the appointment due to them forgetting to order what they need for her fitting.\nWhen I called to see if there was anything I could do to get my daughter in and quite honestly completely confused as to why the appointment was even made for that day in the first place or at the the very least why they waited until the night before to notify me of them canceling the appointment I was met with extremely rude and unprofessional staff",

When I finally got to talk to a nurse practitioner she seemed quite perturbed by something else going on instead of being concerned about the issue at hand. I did not get a sense of an organized plan to treat what I had come in for. I was told to find more information out about my ailment from a website. Unfortunately that is why I came to them.. for better answers.  The facility is nice and seems like it could be a wonderful place for treatment. I could have come in on a bad day, however their follow through was less than infrequent and if they did they wanted to charge for talking on the phone. I hope sincerely it was just a random vague experience. I wish them well treating others.",

They don't have a problem taking money, that is what they are good at, but they do have trouble being caring, compassionate and doing what they say they will do at their initial consultation.  They left my daugther struggle with her thyroid for over three weeks. She called and called and called and no reply. She had to reach out to other doctors in the meantime because she was suffering.\nThey wrote her a letter and dismissed her from their practice siting she was not honest about medication dosage and this couldn't be further from the truth.  The doctor would tell my daughter one thing regarding dosage, and the twenty other assistants would say something different, and since she was not allowed to talk to the doctor directly for those three plus weeks, she stuck with what the doctor told her at their last visit.\nThey also blamed her not being compliant which is a lie on their part. She is beyond compliant to treatment and only wants to get better.   She is knowledgeable about her health and stands up for what she knows is true and asks questions, and I supposed many doctors are challenged by this.\nThese people don't care about your health.\nI am a mother urging you to reconsider before going here.\n\nThey also took a double payment of $440 from her last year and still have not resolved it.  They have no good management of their office and good luck getting your calls returned, well, if you want to pay money maybe you can ask a follow up question.\n\nSo they left a very sick girl, who they had just adjusted all of her medication in a drastic way, to fend for herself.  Stay clear of these evil people who care nothing for your health.   I urge you as a mother, I haven't written anything like this ever in my life, but I don't want others to experience the same poor treatment,  I wish I could give Zero stars.\n\nThese are not caring people.  These are not people you want involved in your long term chronic illness that can change from day to day.  Please heed my warning.",

As time went on and the enourmous ammount of supplements increased my daughter began vomiting and having periods of low bp and she called them and took a day or so for a response. They continued to say it was die off and didnt take her seriously when she said she thought the supplements were doing it. She ended up taking herself off after researching the side effects, which were nausea, vomiting and could lower bp. She improved right away. No more vomiting etc. I think they are well intentioned, but find they dont listen. The apts were long, seemed like we talked about the same things and never really accomplished anything. Prices are extremely high in my opinion. Drs will not talk to you on the phone, you have to talk to nurse and Im sorry but its never good to go through a second person if you want accuracy. Overall I was dissatisfied. In light of the response I would like to add we were told by receptionist the providers do not talk to patients on the phone, that you have to go through receptionist.",

She has successfully diagnosed and treated my hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue, torn meniscus,  hyper extended knee and menopause expertly, with the latest medical knowledge and information.\n\nIn the past I spent over $ 4000 during a 10 month period with Pro Health and their system of referrals for back pain. I was forced to finally  buy my own MRI to find a herniated disk, pay a Radiologist to tell my Dr. then have to spend thousands more for a shot and a Dr's approval.  At that point I decided to change who I trusted.\n\nI highly recommend Debra Muth.",

My sincerest thank you's you saved us!! My daughter and I we're very tired and sad all the time thinking we were never going to get over this but we did!!

         "It really saddens me to write this but I wish I would have learned this sooner.  Dr. Muth was helpful in getting me diagnosed and started me on a medication routine. I was told to come every 3 months and started going in January of 2016, so almost 3 years. Not only was an end plan never discussed but I also felt like I was paying so much money for such short visits. I dealt with it because I was scared to switch to another provider and thought this was just how I'd feel forever. I never had dramatic improvements in my symptoms just felt a little better. This past April was my last appointment. I drove 2 hours to my appointment, my husband had left work early, had saved up the $300+ dollars and was all checked in, waiting to go into the room. I went into the room where the nurse/MA took my vitals and updated my labs and says she will be in shortly. Erica was actually who ended up coming into my room, who I had never seen in my history of going to Serenity. She explained that Dr. Muth was sick and that is why she was filling in for her. Let me say that I totally understand being sick and especially in this type of field you do not want to go to work sick, but I feel I should have at least been called or told about this and given the option to continue with my appointment or reschedule. I still had to pay about the same amount, and many things I brought up I heard, \"Oh I'm not sure about that, I will have to check in with Dr. Muth about that.\" It was a completely useless appointment. I ended up writing a letter about how I was disappointed and didn't agree with this, so they had Dr. Muth call me for a phone appointment, which made me feel much better. She wanted me to get an amino acid test done before my next appointment which was the next month so I was sent the lab kit and it was to be sent out the next day. Not only did the test not get the sent the next day, but when I finally received it (2 weeks before my appointment-not enough time to do and for the Dr to get the results therefore resulting in another useless appointment) it was the WRONG test. I cancelled my appointment and decided I was done dealing with all of it. I started seeing my new LLMD in August and in my 3 appointments with him so far, he talks about an end plan for this treatment, is MUCH cheaper, spends more time with me, and they are not unorganized like Serenity. In hindsight, I now see Serenity as a place that wants to help others but doesn't have the capabilities or organizational system needed and also way overcharges. I believe I was almost used for my money now that I have had such a different experience. I hope this helps others that are struggling to get the courage and motivation to find other care!",

Dr. Brown was great but when Dr. Muth became involved in my case, everything went downhill fast.  They don't return messages, They want to charge you to answer questions, they are not concise or caring in anyway. They dismissed me as a patient after four weeks of not returning calls because I wanted to talk to Dr. Muth about a medication that she prescribed that I had told her I didn't want to use at our first visit and she agreed we wouldn't go that direction. Her daughter who is the office manager is the least professional person I have ever encountered, loud and talks over you. I actually lost some respect for Dr. Muth when I found out she was her daughter.  I am very disappointed.  I liked Dr. Brown but not worth the trouble of going here if you want to be cared for.  I was struggling with my health and they didn't care enough to call me back for over three weeks.\n\nMy current LLMD confirms their treatments for lyme are dangerous and not effective.

         "I live on the East Coast and several years ago, I had some medical issues that multiple doctors (like 5) could not diagnose properly.  One doctor said I had ADHD and depression at the same time!  Desperate, I called Dr. Muth's office (as I grew up in Wisconsin and was very familiar with Dr. Konetski) and bought a plane ticket.\n\nDr. Muth solved my issue (which was thyroid) in the matter of minutes and tested to verify.\n\nLater, my husband and I were having fertility issues - we tried for 2.5 years.  Dr. Muth reviewed my information and continually told me that \"it wasn't me.\"  She sent me lab work for my husband to get tested at a clinic.  He got tested by Shady Grove Fertility, which is a nationally recognized clinic and the results came back normal.  I called Dr. Muth back (yes, this is all over the phone, she never actually met my husband!), and told her the news.  She responded by asking me to read the numbers to her - she disagreed with their analysis and told me he needed two over the counter supplements (natural, might I add).  She said if I wasn't pregnant in 3 months to call her back.... well... it only took 2 months... AFTER 2.5 YEARS OF TRYING!!\n\nSeriously.... this woman is amazing!  She gets down to the root of the problem... and swiftly. She doesn't jump to conclusions and she uses lab work to verify everything.  AND she uses natural means first.  If you are suffering with issues or feel like no doctor really solves your problems.... this doctor is for you!",

         "I would not suggest Serenity Clinic for your healthcare needs. Working in the health care industry since 2000 as a Nurse, a PhD Researcher, and having a husband who is a physician as well, I am well aware of the standards that should occur in a medical practice. Unfortunately, Serenity is not managed or run in a manner that supports patients needs (both emotional and physical).\n\nAlthough I support integrative and functional medicine which is in itself a legitimate approach, the focus on \"non-taditional medicine\" at Serenity, such as testing and treating for parasites/viruses/bacteria detected through \"radio waves\" from a device around your neck, is not evidence-based nor is the foundation that many health and disease problems originate from Lyme's. During my visit, this was the emphasis of care and not something that makes sense with all patients.\n\nWhat was the most worrisome, was the communication and processing of results and follow-up. I had to call the clinic multiple times (>4) to obtain my labs results. On one occasion, I called for over a 2-hour period of time in the middle of the day and there was no one at the desk to answer my call. This is unusual in today's medical practice. Most clinics would average a callback to their patient's in a much shorter timed usually within 1-2 days (as examples Prohealth, Aurora and Froedtert). I left messages for MA's and front desk staff and eventually had to call the lab myself and have the results faxed to another practitioner so I could be aware of my thyroid levels that impacted my fertility treatment at another clinic. Despite communicating my concerns/frustrations with lack of follow-up, I never received my results or a follow-up call from the clinic to address my concerns or discuss a follow-up appointment.\n\nMy last concern is the misinterpretation that \"Dr.\" is portrayed for many of the practitioners at this clinic, when in fact they are not doctorate level Nurse Practitioners nor are they MD's. Although I have my PhD and would be considered a \"Dr\" I do not represent myself in that manner to prevent confusion that I can care for someone with \"medical problems\" like a physician is able. I would caution you as a patient to not put too much trust into this practice based on the poor management, communication, diagnostic techniques, and follow-up. I would suggest rather you locate an Integrative Medicine MD or Functional Medicine MD for a holistic approach combined with conventional medicinal practice.",

My husband had to schedule and pay his assistant to come in to work  so he can leave early to pick the children up from daycare.  Then....  I get a call THE EVENING BEFORE  her appointment telling me that we will need to reschedule the appointment due to them forgetting to order what they need for her fitting.\nWhen I called to see if there was anything I could do to get my daughter in and quite honestly completely confused as to why the appointment was even made for that day in the first place or at the the very least why they waited until the night before to notify me of them canceling the appointment I was met with extremely rude and unprofessional staff",

I did not get a sense of an organized plan to treat what I had come in for. I was told to find more information out about my ailment from a website. Unfortunately that is why I came to them.. for better answers.  The facility is nice and seems like it could be a wonderful place for treatment. I could have come in on a bad day, however their follow through was less than infrequent and if they did they wanted to charge for talking on the phone.

She doesn't, but the Dr wanted to begin treatment immediately and test for it later. The biofeedback test was an additional $40 and took about 5 minutes.  Counter staff was friendly and maybe it's a good practice to be treated at if your well off or have fantastic insurance, but we simply can't afford their feee schedule at $380/hr for a simple onsultc, treatment is probably even more expensive but I can't comment on that as we can't afford to go back.

         "Shame on these terrible people who care nothing for my daughters chronic health issues. They don't have a problem taking money, that is what they are good at, but they do have trouble being caring, compassionate and doing what they say they will do at their initial consultation.  They left my daugther struggle with her thyroid for over three weeks. She called and called and called and no reply. She had to reach out to other doctors in the meantime because she was suffering.\nThey wrote her a letter and dismissed her from their practice siting she was not honest about medication dosage and this couldn't be further from the truth.  The doctor would tell my daughter one thing regarding dosage, and the twenty other assistants would say something different, and since she was not allowed to talk to the doctor directly for those three plus weeks, she stuck with what the doctor told her at their last visit.\nThey also blamed her not being compliant which is a lie on their part. She is beyond compliant to treatment and only wants to get better.   She is knowledgeable about her health and stands up for what she knows is true and asks questions, and I supposed many doctors are challenged by this.\nThese people don't care about your health.\nI am a mother urging you to reconsider before going here.\n\nThey also took a double payment of $440 from her last year and still have not resolved it.  They have no good management of their office and good luck getting your calls returned, well, if you want to pay money maybe you can ask a follow up question.\n\nSo they left a very sick girl, who they had just adjusted all of her medication in a drastic way, to fend for herself.  Stay clear of these evil people who care nothing for your health.   I urge you as a mother, I haven't written anything like this ever in my life, but I don't want others to experience the same poor treatment,  I wish I could give Zero stars.\n\nThese are not caring people.  These are not people you want involved in your long term chronic illness that can change from day to day.  Please heed my warning.",

As time went on and the enourmous ammount of supplements increased my daughter began vomiting and having periods of low bp and she called them and took a day or so for a response. They continued to say it was die off and didnt take her seriously when she said she thought the supplements were doing it. She ended up taking herself off after researching the side effects, which were nausea, vomiting and could lower bp. She improved right away. No more vomiting etc. I think they are well intentioned, but find they dont listen. The apts were long, seemed like we talked about the same things and never really accomplished anything. Prices are extremely high in my opinion. Drs will not talk to you on the phone, you have to talk to nurse and Im sorry but its never good to go through a second person if you want accuracy. Overall I was dissatisfied. In light of the response I would like to add we were told by receptionist the providers do not talk to patients on the phone, that you have to go through receptionist.",

My sincerest thank you's you saved us!! My daughter and I we're very tired and sad all the time thinking we were never going to get over this but we did!!

         "It really saddens me to write this but I wish I would have learned this sooner.  Dr. Muth was helpful in getting me diagnosed and started me on a medication routine. I was told to come every 3 months and started going in January of 2016, so almost 3 years. Not only was an end plan never discussed but I also felt like I was paying so much money for such short visits. I dealt with it because I was scared to switch to another provider and thought this was just how I'd feel forever. I never had dramatic improvements in my symptoms just felt a little better. This past April was my last appointment. I drove 2 hours to my appointment, my husband had left work early, had saved up the $300+ dollars and was all checked in, waiting to go into the room. I went into the room where the nurse/MA took my vitals and updated my labs and says she will be in shortly. Erica was actually who ended up coming into my room, who I had never seen in my history of going to Serenity. She explained that Dr. Muth was sick and that is why she was filling in for her. Let me say that I totally understand being sick and especially in this type of field you do not want to go to work sick, but I feel I should have at least been called or told about this and given the option to continue with my appointment or reschedule. I still had to pay about the same amount, and many things I brought up I heard, \"Oh I'm not sure about that, I will have to check in with Dr. Muth about that.\" It was a completely useless appointment. I ended up writing a letter about how I was disappointed and didn't agree with this, so they had Dr. Muth call me for a phone appointment, which made me feel much better. She wanted me to get an amino acid test done before my next appointment which was the next month so I was sent the lab kit and it was to be sent out the next day. Not only did the test not get the sent the next day, but when I finally received it (2 weeks before my appointment-not enough time to do and for the Dr to get the results therefore resulting in another useless appointment) it was the WRONG test. I cancelled my appointment and decided I was done dealing with all of it. I started seeing my new LLMD in August and in my 3 appointments with him so far, he talks about an end plan for this treatment, is MUCH cheaper, spends more time with me, and they are not unorganized like Serenity. In hindsight, I now see Serenity as a place that wants to help others but doesn't have the capabilities or organizational system needed and also way overcharges. I believe I was almost used for my money now that I have had such a different experience. I hope this helps others that are struggling to get the courage and motivation to find other care!",

Her daughter who is the office manager is the least professional person I have ever encountered, loud and talks over you. I actually lost some respect for Dr. Muth when I found out she was her daughter.  I am very disappointed.  I liked Dr. Brown but not worth the trouble of going here if you want to be cared for.

         "I live on the East Coast and several years ago, I had some medical issues that multiple doctors (like 5) could not diagnose properly.  One doctor said I had ADHD and depression at the same time!  Desperate, I called Dr. Muth's office (as I grew up in Wisconsin and was very familiar with Dr. Konetski) and bought a plane ticket.\n\nDr. Muth solved my issue (which was thyroid) in the matter of minutes and tested to verify.\n\nLater, my husband and I were having fertility issues - we tried for 2.5 years.  Dr. Muth reviewed my information and continually told me that \"it wasn't me.\"  She sent me lab work for my husband to get tested at a clinic.  He got tested by Shady Grove Fertility, which is a nationally recognized clinic and the results came back normal.  I called Dr. Muth back (yes, this is all over the phone, she never actually met my husband!), and told her the news.  She responded by asking me to read the numbers to her - she disagreed with their analysis and told me he needed two over the counter supplements (natural, might I add).  She said if I wasn't pregnant in 3 months to call her back.... well... it only took 2 months... AFTER 2.5 YEARS OF TRYING!!\n\nSeriously.... this woman is amazing!  She gets down to the root of the problem... and swiftly. She doesn't jump to conclusions and she uses lab work to verify everything.  AND she uses natural means first.  If you are suffering with issues or feel like no doctor really solves your problems.... this doctor is for you!",

         "I would not suggest Serenity Clinic for your healthcare needs. Working in the health care industry since 2000 as a Nurse, a PhD Researcher, and having a husband who is a physician as well, I am well aware of the standards that should occur in a medical practice. Unfortunately, Serenity is not managed or run in a manner that supports patients needs (both emotional and physical).\n\nAlthough I support integrative and functional medicine which is in itself a legitimate approach, the focus on \"non-taditional medicine\" at Serenity, such as testing and treating for parasites/viruses/bacteria detected through \"radio waves\" from a device around your neck, is not evidence-based nor is the foundation that many health and disease problems originate from Lyme's. During my visit, this was the emphasis of care and not something that makes sense with all patients.\n\nWhat was the most worrisome, was the communication and processing of results and follow-up. I had to call the clinic multiple times (>4) to obtain my labs results. On one occasion, I called for over a 2-hour period of time in the middle of the day and there was no one at the desk to answer my call. This is unusual in today's medical practice. Most clinics would average a callback to their patient's in a much shorter timed usually within 1-2 days (as examples Prohealth, Aurora and Froedtert). I left messages for MA's and front desk staff and eventually had to call the lab myself and have the results faxed to another practitioner so I could be aware of my thyroid levels that impacted my fertility treatment at another clinic. Despite communicating my concerns/frustrations with lack of follow-up, I never received my results or a follow-up call from the clinic to address my concerns or discuss a follow-up appointment.\n\nMy last concern is the misinterpretation that \"Dr.\" is portrayed for many of the practitioners at this clinic, when in fact they are not doctorate level Nurse Practitioners nor are they MD's. Although I have my PhD and would be considered a \"Dr\" I do not represent myself in that manner to prevent confusion that I can care for someone with \"medical problems\" like a physician is able. I would caution you as a patient to not put too much trust into this practice based on the poor management, communication, diagnostic techniques, and follow-up. I would suggest rather you locate an Integrative Medicine MD or Functional Medicine MD for a holistic approach combined with conventional medicinal practice.",
