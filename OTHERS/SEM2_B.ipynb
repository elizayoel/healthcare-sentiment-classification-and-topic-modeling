         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

         "Don’t go to CAPS. I was left completely unsatisfied by the care I received from my CAPS psychiatrist during my senior year. I left her care in worse shape than when I first saw her. I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

I asked the receptionist if I really needed the full 30 minutes to fill out paperwork to which her response was \"I don't know if you're capable of that or not.\" She offered to reschedule for the next available appointment, even though there was not another soul in the waiting room.

I have never regretted seeing her the first time and actually look forward to seeing her and all the next time!",

I will definitely be a returning customer!\n\n...\n\nSadly not what it used to be. I haven’t been to Lunchbox in a while but I don’t know that I’ll be back. The esthetician was a very nice girl and held good conversation but her skills could use some improvement. I went home with SO much breakage and missed spots. I know, breakage happens with every visit but I’ve never experienced this much in all my Brazilian waxes over the years. I feel like she didn’t take the time to ensure the leftover hairs were taken care of and I just spent over an hour with a flashlight, mirror, and tweezers cleaning up my lady parts. Definitely not happy about spending $58 (before tip) just to have to remove what was left behind. Probably my own fault for not checking the work before I left, but I assumed I was dealing with professional waxers and didn’t think about it. Maybe a different esthetician would be better? Either way, I’m now very wary about giving them my business.",

         "I have suffered from chronic pain for nearly a decade now. The pain began after I had my first child, and over the years, as well as after subsequent children, new areas of pain began to surface. I have been to every traditional doctor you can imagine, my PCP, pain specialists, and even physical therapists. Despite the many x-rays, MRI's, and all of the blood work, perscription pain killers and pain injections, my pain never was relieved and no source of pain could be identified. My PCP began telling me that my pain was simply psycho-semantic.\n\nBut clearly my pain was coming from somewhere, my shoulders pop and grind as they move, loud enough for others to look at me wildly and wonder if I am alright; my hips and knees do the same. I even went to other chiropractors to try and find some relief. While I did find some very temporary relief from treatments from the other chiropractors, nothing was long lasting and eventually I wanted to find the real source of pain. No matter what kind of testing was done, no one could find why I was in so much pain.\n\nFinally, I gave up and figured I would just learn to live with my pain, after all maybe it really was psycho-semantic! Then, I became pregnant with my fourth baby, and the pain became unbearable. I would wake up in the morning and my hands would be so numb that I would have to run hot water over them just to get any sensation back, my grip started to go, and I had no idea what to do. That's when I found Dr. Myshka.\n\nIn just three adjustments, my pregnancy related carpel tunnel was gone. My headaches disappeared, and I found energy I haven't had in years. The reason Dr. Myshka works when other chiropractors didn't is because he uses the Gonstead system, and he has 30+ years of experience.\n\nI knew after my first consultation that Dr. Myshka was different than any other chiropractor I have ever seen. His tools are different, his methods are different, and his naked eye spotted every single thing that other doctors told me were wrong through x-ray testing and MRI's without me saying a word to him about it, and then he also found more.\n\nNot only did Dr. Myshka spot everything structurally wrong with my spine, but he noticed vitamin deficiencies, recommended new sleeping positions, and every little bit of information he has given me has made a huge difference in the quality of my daily life. I was resigned to the fact that I would suffer from pain for the rest of my life, but in less than a week, Dr. Myshka has proven to me that with regular adjustments, good vitamins, good food, and changes to my posture, I can minimize my pain and prevent any further injuries.\n\nI was praying for a doctor that would see me as a whole human being, and not just another source of income. Dr. Myshka is the answer to my prayers, and I am so thankful that we have him in the N.W.A. area! Thanks Doctor, and please don't ever leave!",

They worked but I had so many side effects I wasn't sure if they were worth the cost. I started coming to Ketamine SLC about a year ago and have weaned off of all but the Lyrica. I am not happy all the time with nothing ever really bothering me like I was on antidepressants. I feel like a real person, with real emotions that go up and down. What I no longer have is that deep, dark, feeling of despair that depression was. I don't have to deal with the constant side effects from all my old meds plus the ones I probably didn't even realize I was enduring. Let me tell you however that taking Ketamine is no joke. My last treatment was five shots. The place is idealic for relaxing and drifting away but the trip is intense. I feel like my mind is working out every fear and anxiety I have in just a few hours. There is no escaping it and there is no convincing yourself when you are in the middle of it that it is just in your head. Ketamine is a cure, I only have to get shots about every three months, but it is not just a fun trip down the rabbit hole. At least not for me. With that said, I can't imagine a staff that cares more about taking care of you through your treatment. They are truly amazing people.",

Called Dynamic and told them that we had been waiting on this appointment for 2 weeks and she was hurting. They got her in today at 1. She believes they just put some medicine on her then pulled her tooth with their fingers. 😂 She hasn't a clue shots and pliers were involved. $140 well spent.

         "My husky was just shy of one year old when he developed an extremely aggressive form of cataracts. From the day we noticed redness and uvulitis in both eyes to the week wait to see the specialists (we were giving him prescribed steroid drops in this time) he was running in to walls and getting whacked by his fetch balls that he couldn’t see flying towards his face. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see this rambunctious husky unable to play or walk without running in to things. He was scared and would not walk unless he had our legs to lean on along the way. When given the price for the surgery and after care, I was a little apprehensive to tell my husband because I was afraid of what his reaction would be. Not everyone shares my love of animals so this would be a test. Thankfully we were on the same page. Our dogs are our kids (we have two human ones too) and the same responsibilities are attached to that ownership. Would we let our children go blind if there was a surgery to help it? Absolutely not. We would work extra shifts, sell things, do whatever it took to ensure that our children could live out the rest of their lives to the fullest. To be able to throw a ball and for him to catch it in mid air makes it all worth it. Thank you everyone for all of your help along the way. You’re amazing!!",

         "I was first diagnosed with Hallux Rigidus (stiff big toe) on 9/24/2012 by an orthopedic doctor after experiencing soreness of my right big toe. After trying conservative treatments to manage it, I was told the only way to truly stop the degeneration of the toe joint was a cheilectomy surgery.\n\nI was not interested in surgery and continued to manage the discomfort by using orthopedic shoes, ice and NSAIDS.  Having a high pain tolerance, I ignored the pain.  I began focusing on the other joint pains that were bothering me:  herniated spinal discs, and deteriorating knee menisci.  In 2016, I had a two-level spinal fusion.  In 2017, I had a meniscectomy as well as meniscus reattachment surgery.  Toe surgery was the least of my worries.\n\nHowever, in 2018, as I continued ignoring the slow worsening my big toe joint, I realized that I could no longer wear heels comfortably, and that my foot was continuously sore after each day at work. I revisited the orthopedic doctor, who told me that the degeneration had worsened and that I would need a big toe fusion.  I decided that I would eventually have to have surgery to \"fix\" my problem.  However, I kept procrastinating scheduling a date for surgery.\n\nMonths later, the pain in my toe could be felt on every step I took, and the mundane task of walking my dog became a terrible chore.  I also began feeling increased pain in my second toe which was curling up and around the big toe. This also led to pain beneath the ball of my foot. Doing my favorite yoga stretch, the downward dog, was very uncomfortable, and I knew I had to do something soon.\n\nIn 2019, I was eventually referred to Dr. Jordan Stewart, a cousin of my husband's clients, and a well-regarded podiatrist and foot and ankle surgeon.  Upon meeting Dr. Stewart, I felt completely comfortable with him.  He is the only doctor that I have experience with who never made me feel rushed.  He took the time to explain the mechanics of the entire foot and went into great detail about the procedures he would perform to rid the pain that I had been tolerating for so many years. He explained the surgery, the recovery, and eventually how life would be like after getting your big toe joint fused.  As a person who is also very detailed oriented, I knew Dr. Stewart was the perfect fit.\n\nThen Covid-19 happened.  All elective surgeries had to be cancelled for most of 2020.\n\nIt wasn't until December of 2020 that I finally was able to schedule surgery, and I was relieved to have done so.  I had my big toe joint fused with a screw, my 2nd toe fused with a wire, my 2nd metatarsal cut and shortened and secured with a screw, and a calf release to help me have greater range of motion.  All went well, but I received the shocking news from Dr. Stewart that he discovered gout tophi in my big toe.  He showed his concern by sending me for bloodwork and referring me to a rheumatologist.\n\nAlmost 3 months post op, I suddenly experienced my first real gout attack of near my pink toe.  The pain gradually became unbearable, and Dr. Stewart was kind enough to come into in his office on a Sunday afternoon as an emergency appointment.  He administered a steroid shot, which was a huge relief, but stated that shots are strictly used no more than twice as emergency treatment. I truly appreciated him coming in on the weekend to get me through this very painful episode.\n\nI have fully recovered after surgery and am being seen by the rheumatologist to manage my gout.  All I can say is that Dr. Jordan Stewart gave my life back by repairing a problem that I had been suffering with for almost a decade.  He is always very encouraging, empathetic, and extremely knowledgeable.\n\nI am now able to be active again by walking, running, strength training, and once again, am back to stretching in my favorite downward facing dog pose.  I'm one happy patient!\n\nElaine Fanning",

         "COVID-19 Update:\nI really like Rock Canyon but this is just information for anyone who is vulnerable and needs to be very cautious. (First problem) This pharmacy did not require masks ever. When Provo mandated masks they started to require them but probably won't require them in the future when the mandate goes away. (Second problem) They don't actually wear their masks or take it seriously. Last time in was in there were 5 people working there. Only two of the 5 people were wearing masks. Two had no masks at all and one was wearing the mask around their chin. And of the two people wearing masks, one was wearing a mask that has a respirator on it which we all know is extremely dangerous for other people as it still releases germs (virus) back into the air. This person was at the front desk which means they didn't have 6 ft social distance from customers when ringing up orders. Not great...\n\nI can't recommend this as a place to visit during covid-19 if you are vulnerable. In general, if a person doesn't need to be in there long and isn't worried then go for it but if you need to be careful I'd say choose somewhere else.\n\nIf I could I would give Rock Canyon a 4.5. They are always friendly and good to work with. Some of the people at the front desk have proven very helpful in trying to find coupons and dealing with insurance. However, it can be really slow even if you call in. They often don't have what we need in stock. These are minor complaints and overall a great place.",

She followed through on Sun by calling the pharmacy for antibiotics then seeing me THAT SAME day!  She and her staff are my extended family after two years.  I have never regretted seeing her the first time and actually look forward to seeing her and all the next time!",

They are very efficient and Dr Lee is amazing. I had a chipped front tooth and Dr Lee got me in immediately and got my tooth looking brand new. I also didn't have a long wait time which was great. I would highly recommend this facility to everyone.",

Not only does this happen in offices, but in the halls too. It’s uncalled for and unprofessional. You will never get a chance for a promotion if you are not friends with any department heads and that’s the truth. Favoritism is spread like wildfire throughout each department and even beyond the employees. I love the residents here and I love what I do for them, but that’s about all I love when it comes to this place of employment. I worked here in 2014 for a year and things were a lot different. I came back in 2016 and Things were a mess. What’s crazy is if state inspectors or anyone big comes in, we put on the biggest show ever (we could win a Grammy award).

         "Residents are cared for, employees are not.\nSome of us have worked here for years (I’m on my 3rd year & counting) and get talked to like trash on a daily basis. Not only does this happen in offices, but in the halls too. It’s uncalled for and unprofessional. You will never get a chance for a promotion if you are not friends with any department heads and that’s the truth. Favoritism is spread like wildfire throughout each department and even beyond the employees. I love the residents here and I love what I do for them, but that’s about all I love when it comes to this place of employment. I worked here in 2014 for a year and things were a lot different. I came back in 2016 and Things were a mess. What’s crazy is if state inspectors or anyone big comes in, we put on the biggest show ever (we could win a Grammy award). Hopefully things will change so this is a pleasant place to work for again.",

Was supposed to take the meds the next morning then bring him in. Dr. Walter's decided he wanted to do alot of other stuff in the same visit. Which I said no to. Told them what I felt comfortable for them to do, then Dr. Walter's refused to pull the 2 teeth that were causing my son pain  and discomfort, AFTER I MEDICATED HIM. He was ok with doing it when he thought he was going to be able to do other stuff. Had to take my son to another dentist, which turned out to be 100% better.

         "The short version: We went in for shots for the cats and discovered one needed teeth extracted. I've worked in vet clinics before so I knew it was a pricey proceedure and didn't mind that as it was necessary for my kitty's health. But we ended up paying literally three times what we were quoted and every single quote they gave us was incorrect. We found out via phone call once, and the other two times AT THE REGISTER.\n\nThe long version: the cats teeth were pretty bad and the vet diagnosed several extractions. Dr. Stone told us that her canines would have to be pulled as well as some molars. The vet tech brought us a quote. There was no high/low quote, mind you. There was one figure and we were told to expect to pay that figure. I asked them as well to shave her belly while she was under. I got an acknowledgement each time and saw him write it on the chart.\n\nWell I come to pick up my girl and the lady at the register explains that one of her teeth fell out during the proceedure and had been added to the bill. So it went from about $325 to $370. That's not bad and stuff happens. I get it. I paid the bill and was happy to see my kitty again.\n\nThe vet and a tech brings her out and explains that she did well, that aside from the one tooth, there were no complications and just showered her with compliments. Very sweet lady and very kind tech. Then the vet proceeded to explain the NEXT proceedure. I was a little confused and asked if a second diagnosis had been made. She patiently explained that all they had done was thoroughly clean her teeth and extract the two teeth in the back (including the one that fell out) and that she still needed to come in to get her canines out. I assumed a misunderstanding on my part but went ahead and accepted the quote for the second round of extractions. It was an additional $350. Bummed, but yknow. What can you do? So I signed it and took my cat. I noticed immediately that her belly wasn't shaved and asked about it. The vet and tech both apologized and promised they'd do it the next time she came in.\n\nRound two started off fine. I got my girl all checked in nice and quickly. As always, everyone was super nice. I want to stress that at no point was anyone ever rude. I left and about two and a half hours later got a phone call from one of the techs. She informed us that they'd made a mistake on our quote and quoted us for one extraction instead of two. So the total was going to be $470, instead of $350. The cat was already under proceedure and again, the tech was very kind an apologetic. I mentioned that we'd also need meds for both cats for the upcoming move to Colorado (long drive!) and she said that she'd take care of it.\n\nI show up to pick up the cat and they've charged me an extra $30-something for the meds (which is a high enough add on that I wished they'd mentioned it) and once again the cats belly was not shaved. They said to come back in five days so they could check on her. I said okay and scheduled that appointment for today.\n\nNow today was the final straw. I went in and they took her to the back. Everything seemed fine until the vet came out and showed me the extraction sites. They were infected and needed to be taken care of. She (very kindly) offered to take care of it today since I leave tomorrow, and I agreed. Before she went back though, I asked what I was going to be paying and she said that I would only have to pay for the anesthetic. I thanked her a bunch and turned to the receptionist for further clarification. The receptionist told me it would only be $49 total. I was elated and thanked her.\n\nWhen I returned this afternoon, they not only tried to charge me for the proceedure, but once they finally agreed to take that off the bill (AS PROMISED), they charged me $87. I was pissed and only then did they get irritable with me. I left because I'm not the kind of person to yell at people at their jobs but wow was I upset.\n\nIn short, do NOT trust the quotes. We went in for a $350 proceedure and have ended up paying about 1k.",

She went above and beyond to perfect my Brazilian and made sure I was happy. Clearly this location cares about their customers and I’m so grateful Bri took the time out of her day to help. I will definitely be a returning customer!\n\n...\n\nSadly not what it used to be. I haven’t been to Lunchbox in a while but I don’t know that I’ll be back. The esthetician was a very nice girl and held good conversation but her skills could use some improvement. I went home with SO much breakage and missed spots. I know, breakage happens with every visit but I’ve never experienced this much in all my Brazilian waxes over the years. I feel like she didn’t take the time to ensure the leftover hairs were taken care of and I just spent over an hour with a flashlight, mirror, and tweezers cleaning up my lady parts. Definitely not happy about spending $58 (before tip) just to have to remove what was left behind. Probably my own fault for not checking the work before I left, but I assumed I was dealing with professional waxers and didn’t think about it. Maybe a different esthetician would be better? Either way, I’m now very wary about giving them my business.",

         "I have suffered from chronic pain for nearly a decade now. The pain began after I had my first child, and over the years, as well as after subsequent children, new areas of pain began to surface. I have been to every traditional doctor you can imagine, my PCP, pain specialists, and even physical therapists. Despite the many x-rays, MRI's, and all of the blood work, perscription pain killers and pain injections, my pain never was relieved and no source of pain could be identified. My PCP began telling me that my pain was simply psycho-semantic.\n\nBut clearly my pain was coming from somewhere, my shoulders pop and grind as they move, loud enough for others to look at me wildly and wonder if I am alright; my hips and knees do the same. I even went to other chiropractors to try and find some relief. While I did find some very temporary relief from treatments from the other chiropractors, nothing was long lasting and eventually I wanted to find the real source of pain. No matter what kind of testing was done, no one could find why I was in so much pain.\n\nFinally, I gave up and figured I would just learn to live with my pain, after all maybe it really was psycho-semantic! Then, I became pregnant with my fourth baby, and the pain became unbearable. I would wake up in the morning and my hands would be so numb that I would have to run hot water over them just to get any sensation back, my grip started to go, and I had no idea what to do. That's when I found Dr. Myshka.\n\nIn just three adjustments, my pregnancy related carpel tunnel was gone. My headaches disappeared, and I found energy I haven't had in years. The reason Dr. Myshka works when other chiropractors didn't is because he uses the Gonstead system, and he has 30+ years of experience.\n\nI knew after my first consultation that Dr. Myshka was different than any other chiropractor I have ever seen. His tools are different, his methods are different, and his naked eye spotted every single thing that other doctors told me were wrong through x-ray testing and MRI's without me saying a word to him about it, and then he also found more.\n\nNot only did Dr. Myshka spot everything structurally wrong with my spine, but he noticed vitamin deficiencies, recommended new sleeping positions, and every little bit of information he has given me has made a huge difference in the quality of my daily life. I was resigned to the fact that I would suffer from pain for the rest of my life, but in less than a week, Dr. Myshka has proven to me that with regular adjustments, good vitamins, good food, and changes to my posture, I can minimize my pain and prevent any further injuries.\n\nI was praying for a doctor that would see me as a whole human being, and not just another source of income. Dr. Myshka is the answer to my prayers, and I am so thankful that we have him in the N.W.A. area! Thanks Doctor, and please don't ever leave!",

         "I have been taking antidepressants and Lyrica for chronic depression and fibromyalgia most of my adult life. They worked but I had so many side effects I wasn't sure if they were worth the cost. I started coming to Ketamine SLC about a year ago and have weaned off of all but the Lyrica. I am not happy all the time with nothing ever really bothering me like I was on antidepressants. I feel like a real person, with real emotions that go up and down. What I no longer have is that deep, dark, feeling of despair that depression was. I don't have to deal with the constant side effects from all my old meds plus the ones I probably didn't even realize I was enduring. Let me tell you however that taking Ketamine is no joke. My last treatment was five shots. The place is idealic for relaxing and drifting away but the trip is intense. I feel like my mind is working out every fear and anxiety I have in just a few hours. There is no escaping it and there is no convincing yourself when you are in the middle of it that it is just in your head. Ketamine is a cure, I only have to get shots about every three months, but it is not just a fun trip down the rabbit hole. At least not for me. With that said, I can't imagine a staff that cares more about taking care of you through your treatment. They are truly amazing people.",

         "My husky was just shy of one year old when he developed an extremely aggressive form of cataracts. From the day we noticed redness and uvulitis in both eyes to the week wait to see the specialists (we were giving him prescribed steroid drops in this time) he was running in to walls and getting whacked by his fetch balls that he couldn’t see flying towards his face. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see this rambunctious husky unable to play or walk without running in to things. He was scared and would not walk unless he had our legs to lean on along the way. When given the price for the surgery and after care, I was a little apprehensive to tell my husband because I was afraid of what his reaction would be. Not everyone shares my love of animals so this would be a test. Thankfully we were on the same page. Our dogs are our kids (we have two human ones too) and the same responsibilities are attached to that ownership. Would we let our children go blind if there was a surgery to help it? Absolutely not. We would work extra shifts, sell things, do whatever it took to ensure that our children could live out the rest of their lives to the fullest. To be able to throw a ball and for him to catch it in mid air makes it all worth it. Thank you everyone for all of your help along the way. You’re amazing!!",

         "I was first diagnosed with Hallux Rigidus (stiff big toe) on 9/24/2012 by an orthopedic doctor after experiencing soreness of my right big toe. After trying conservative treatments to manage it, I was told the only way to truly stop the degeneration of the toe joint was a cheilectomy surgery.\n\nI was not interested in surgery and continued to manage the discomfort by using orthopedic shoes, ice and NSAIDS.  Having a high pain tolerance, I ignored the pain.  I began focusing on the other joint pains that were bothering me:  herniated spinal discs, and deteriorating knee menisci.  In 2016, I had a two-level spinal fusion.  In 2017, I had a meniscectomy as well as meniscus reattachment surgery.  Toe surgery was the least of my worries.\n\nHowever, in 2018, as I continued ignoring the slow worsening my big toe joint, I realized that I could no longer wear heels comfortably, and that my foot was continuously sore after each day at work. I revisited the orthopedic doctor, who told me that the degeneration had worsened and that I would need a big toe fusion.  I decided that I would eventually have to have surgery to \"fix\" my problem.  However, I kept procrastinating scheduling a date for surgery.\n\nMonths later, the pain in my toe could be felt on every step I took, and the mundane task of walking my dog became a terrible chore.  I also began feeling increased pain in my second toe which was curling up and around the big toe. This also led to pain beneath the ball of my foot. Doing my favorite yoga stretch, the downward dog, was very uncomfortable, and I knew I had to do something soon.\n\nIn 2019, I was eventually referred to Dr. Jordan Stewart, a cousin of my husband's clients, and a well-regarded podiatrist and foot and ankle surgeon.  Upon meeting Dr. Stewart, I felt completely comfortable with him.  He is the only doctor that I have experience with who never made me feel rushed.  He took the time to explain the mechanics of the entire foot and went into great detail about the procedures he would perform to rid the pain that I had been tolerating for so many years. He explained the surgery, the recovery, and eventually how life would be like after getting your big toe joint fused.  As a person who is also very detailed oriented, I knew Dr. Stewart was the perfect fit.\n\nThen Covid-19 happened.  All elective surgeries had to be cancelled for most of 2020.\n\nIt wasn't until December of 2020 that I finally was able to schedule surgery, and I was relieved to have done so.  I had my big toe joint fused with a screw, my 2nd toe fused with a wire, my 2nd metatarsal cut and shortened and secured with a screw, and a calf release to help me have greater range of motion.  All went well, but I received the shocking news from Dr. Stewart that he discovered gout tophi in my big toe.  He showed his concern by sending me for bloodwork and referring me to a rheumatologist.\n\nAlmost 3 months post op, I suddenly experienced my first real gout attack of near my pink toe.  The pain gradually became unbearable, and Dr. Stewart was kind enough to come into in his office on a Sunday afternoon as an emergency appointment.  He administered a steroid shot, which was a huge relief, but stated that shots are strictly used no more than twice as emergency treatment. I truly appreciated him coming in on the weekend to get me through this very painful episode.\n\nI have fully recovered after surgery and am being seen by the rheumatologist to manage my gout.  All I can say is that Dr. Jordan Stewart gave my life back by repairing a problem that I had been suffering with for almost a decade.  He is always very encouraging, empathetic, and extremely knowledgeable.\n\nI am now able to be active again by walking, running, strength training, and once again, am back to stretching in my favorite downward facing dog pose.  I'm one happy patient!\n\nElaine Fanning",

One of the reviews I read was racist and offensive and made me sick.  The person who wrote that should be ashamed.  She should stick to \"white\" salons.",

         "COVID-19 Update:\nI really like Rock Canyon but this is just information for anyone who is vulnerable and needs to be very cautious. (First problem) This pharmacy did not require masks ever. When Provo mandated masks they started to require them but probably won't require them in the future when the mandate goes away. (Second problem) They don't actually wear their masks or take it seriously. Last time in was in there were 5 people working there. Only two of the 5 people were wearing masks. Two had no masks at all and one was wearing the mask around their chin. And of the two people wearing masks, one was wearing a mask that has a respirator on it which we all know is extremely dangerous for other people as it still releases germs (virus) back into the air. This person was at the front desk which means they didn't have 6 ft social distance from customers when ringing up orders. Not great...\n\nI can't recommend this as a place to visit during covid-19 if you are vulnerable. In general, if a person doesn't need to be in there long and isn't worried then go for it but if you need to be careful I'd say choose somewhere else.\n\nIf I could I would give Rock Canyon a 4.5. They are always friendly and good to work with. Some of the people at the front desk have proven very helpful in trying to find coupons and dealing with insurance. However, it can be really slow even if you call in. They often don't have what we need in stock. These are minor complaints and overall a great place.",

         "We had been taking our pets (3 dogs) to Olin on White Bear Ave for 6+ years. When it came time to put my first pet Freddie down, it took them over an hour to do it. They gave her a shot in her back and said that she would fall asleep but it didn’t work. They gave her a second shot in her back and that still didn’t make her fall asleep. As she struggled to crawl on the floor into Jim’s lap, licking his face for him to pick her up and take her out of there. 3 techs had to hold her down on the floor to give her the 3rd shot which was in her arm. After the 4th shot -they told us they were surprised that she had a very healthy strong heart. In the same sentence they explained that I made the right decision. My baby girl couldn't walk at all and she fought hard to get out of that room. Then once my baby girl left us, they said it normally would take 30 seconds and that I was lucky it took over an hour. We were in shock and disgust at what had just happened. When I went to pick up her remains, they told me I was picking up the wrong dog. They said \"his name is Frankie\" and explained that \"I must be confused as to which dog I was picking up\". MY GOD- are you kidding me? Needless to say it was a traumatic experience not only to put down my baby girl but then to be told \"I was confused...”  Let’s just say, I will not set another foot in that place. When my 2nd dog had a stroke it was time to put her down. I decided to take my sweetheart to Maryland Ave. Pet Hospital.  The experience was still a difficult one.… yet better than the first. Maryland Ave. didn’t stick two needles in her back and watch her try to walk around the room. They gave her one shot of medicine in her arm, within seconds my sweetheart was snoring on the table. I was able to listen to her snore before she left us. We are forever grateful to Maryland Ave Pet Hospital for making this a much better experience than the first -THANK YOU -Maryland Ave Pet Hospital!",

Maryland Ave. didn’t stick two needles in her back and watch her try to walk around the room. They gave her one shot of medicine in her arm, within seconds my sweetheart was snoring on the table. I was able to listen to her snore before she left us. We are forever grateful to Maryland Ave Pet Hospital for making this a much better experience than the first -THANK YOU -Maryland Ave Pet Hospital!",

         "No one wants to be a patient in the Emergency Room but on Wednesday, January 13, 2021 I was fortunate enough to have Dr. Florence on duty and he would be overseeing my care. I was seen earlier in the week for Oral Thrush that had progressed to Esophageal Thrush along side with Trigeminal Neuralgia. Both conditions are incredibly painful. Feeling somewhat embarrassed for my return visit I was physically exhausted from the pain.  Dr. Florence pulled up a chair, made eye contact with me, and made me feel safe that I could discuss my current situation. Living in Chronic Pain is difficult. The truth is I haven’t always been treated fairly by some doctors and nurses. It shouldn’t be that way but it is. Not everyone is “drug seeking”. Dr. Florence showed me compassion without judgment. He listened intently and together we came up with a game plan to safely get me home and get some much needed sleep.  Dr. Florence, THANK YOU - THANK YOU -   THANK YOU for showing me the way all patients deserve to be treated. THANK YOU for believing me, and THANK YOU for it re-establishing my trust in medical professionals.",
