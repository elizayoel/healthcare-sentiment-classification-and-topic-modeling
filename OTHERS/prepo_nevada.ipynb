As she turned away she muttered, \"Pick a tea\". I was looking for a sign when I noticed there were boxes by the register. Needless to say I got a cup of hot water and a tea bag.

I have an opioid prescription for my should surgery recovery, had to have two tendons put back together. I'm in constant pain but I have been making absolutely sure that I don't abuse my medication, knowing the risk of dependency. I make a 5 day prescription last 2 weeks. Now, the pharmacist pulls me off the side and says that prescription is high and all but acusses me of being an addict. Blatantly ignoring that I don't use the time frame for the prescription. But all of that was just a scare tactic so that I would ask my doctor to change my medication to something that may not help my recovery... just so I wouldn't take some of their supply. So they tried to make me feel guilty for their own benefit. Absolutely deplorable and they should be embarrassed. I will NEVER go there again under any circumstances and I urge you to not go there as well. No one deserves to be insulted tho their face.",

He grabs a brush that is has long blonde strands of hair hanging from it. Hello I'm a brunette that clearly isn't my hair and your not using a dirty brush on me.  He never spoke the whole time and made me feel like my walk in was a total inconvenience.  He never once used a brush on me for my blow out.  Who does a blow out with your fingers.  Worst experience ever and it cost over $50.00.  If I could give this place a minus I would. I call the manager and she says he is a Jr stylist. I don't care a blow out is a basic service.  If the state knew they were using unsanitary brushes and combs that might be an issue.  Never again  so disgusted.",

         "You wait in a reception area full of waiting patients for ONE HOUR. Then you see one assistant for prep eye drops. Then wait another 15 to 20 minutes, then see another assistant who does vision test, then another wait, then yet another assistant who does more tests/scans, then another wait. Finally, you see the doctor who, instead of showing g you your scans and interpreting their meaning,  reads them in another room and simply announces to you the results. After seeing one of a gaggle  of doctors, you are directed to the cashier window where you are told the total owed, after insurance, but no one shows or gives you a billing breakdown so you can see what cost what. In sum, I feel not like an individual patient that gets individual attention, but like a head in the herd being led from one station to another and finally the collection. Staff ARE cordial and friendly, but it still feels like a slick run-em-thru-the-stations business operation (timing out at 2.5 hours).  I'll be looking for another ophthalmologist's office where I feel more like a patient than a dollar sign.",

I have an opioid prescription for my should surgery recovery, had to have two tendons put back together. I'm in constant pain but I have been making absolutely sure that I don't abuse my medication, knowing the risk of dependency. I make a 5 day prescription last 2 weeks. Now, the pharmacist pulls me off the side and says that prescription is high and all but acusses me of being an addict. Blatantly ignoring that I don't use the time frame for the prescription. But all of that was just a scare tactic so that I would ask my doctor to change my medication to something that may not help my recovery... just so I wouldn't take some of their supply. So they tried to make me feel guilty for their own benefit. Absolutely deplorable and they should be embarrassed. I will NEVER go there again under any circumstances and I urge you to not go there as well. No one deserves to be insulted tho their face.",

After calling back a third time to order prescriptions and complain Brenda was rude and lacked basic knowledge, understanding, empathy or ANY type of customer servuce skills. Been using CVS for years, not all the staff are stupid, but this job is being wasted on an incompetent human who don't get the basic idea dealing with individuals who rely on medication and the information from the pharmacy staff to help make sense if it all. Not irritate and inflame an already delicate situation.\nShe's not the only one. Because it was a gentleman who left me on hold first. Maybe all staff should be retrained in customer service, communication and sensitivity training. The district Manager was immediately on it and called me twenty minutes after complaining to Corp. Hopefully his will get better. I'm going to allow them to fix these experiences.",

The service here so horrible I would never recommend someone here.  Management needs to clearly  re train their staff obviously customer service isn't important to them!

We moved to a few different stations and when doing my blow out he couldn't find the products in a drawer that was full of everything a complete mess. He grabs a brush that is has long blonde strands of hair hanging from it. Hello I'm a brunette that clearly isn't my hair and your not using a dirty brush on me.  He never spoke the whole time and made me feel like my walk in was a total inconvenience.  He never once used a brush on me for my blow out.  Who does a blow out with your fingers.  Worst experience ever and it cost over $50.00.  If I could give this place a minus I would. I call the manager and she says he is a Jr stylist. I don't care a blow out is a basic service.  If the state knew they were using unsanitary brushes and combs that might be an issue.  Never again  so disgusted.",

Then wait another 15 to 20 minutes, then see another assistant who does vision test, then another wait, then yet another assistant who does more tests/scans, then another wait. Finally, you see the doctor who, instead of showing g you your scans and interpreting their meaning,  reads them in another room and simply announces to you the results. After seeing one of a gaggle  of doctors, you are directed to the cashier window where you are told the total owed, after insurance, but no one shows or gives you a billing breakdown so you can see what cost what. In sum, I feel not like an individual patient that gets individual attention, but like a head in the herd being led from one station to another and finally the collection.

Then wait another 15 to 20 minutes, then see another assistant who does vision test, then another wait, then yet another assistant who does more tests/scans, then another wait. Finally, you see the doctor who, instead of showing g you your scans and interpreting their meaning,  reads them in another room and simply announces to you the results. After seeing one of a gaggle  of doctors, you are directed to the cashier window where you are told the total owed, after insurance, but no one shows or gives you a billing breakdown so you can see what cost what. In sum, I feel not like an individual patient that gets individual attention, but like a head in the herd being led from one station to another and finally the collection. Staff ARE cordial and friendly, but it still feels like a slick run-em-thru-the-stations business operation (timing out at 2.5 hours).

I have been here 3 times just because I wanted to establish some kind of relationship with a doctor and staff who were also closer to my home. I have a bad reaction to the glaucoma testing drops and the numbing drops.  I have had to tell the tech each time I visited that I CANNOT have those drops. Scary that I have to  remind them each and  every time that I have allergic reactions to these drops because they do not take  the time to read my chart. I saw Dr. Thatch the first 2 times and he was \"ok\". I saw Dr. Hollifield the 3rd time and this man was so unprofessional and condescending. And when I told him he was hurting me while using that glass with the light to view the back of my eye he just rolled his eyes and claimed \"Well, this is how I do it\". Seriously? They also gave me an incorrect diagnosis. I now have a new opthalmologist who is on the other side of town and well worth the drive! She treated me with respect and concern and saw me at my appointment time and when she looked in the back of my eye, she did NOT hurt me. I will never go back to Retina Consultants.

Upon arrival I was treated very poorly, I filled out the paper work, after I handed it to the receptionist she rudely tossed it to the side of her desk with attitude. I waited a significant amount of time. While waiting for their staff to attend to me, I had the urge to use the restroom. I notified the receptionist and she told me I would be seen shortly and I had to wait to use the restroom, I sat back down and waited for a while longer. Finally it got to the point where I was about to piss on the floor in front of them so I went up to the window a second time and let the receptionist know I really couldn’t hold it any longer. Miraculously they suddenly had someone take me back and I was able to relieve myself. The staff continued to treat me poorly, for people who work in the health care industry they really don’t have the adequate people skills or professionalism. The “doctor” didn’t even greet me or mention his name, he just got right to it and treated me like a common criminal, the way I was treated almost would amount to malpractice. I think every staff member needs to be re trained on properly dealing with patients. My experience was so poor I wish I could give them -5 stars. They couldn’t even perform a simple blood draw correctly, Now I have a huge hematoma on my arm since staff can’t even draw blood correctly. Poor treatment, poor customer service, rude, unprofessional and incompetent staff. It’s amazing you haven’t been sued for malpractice yet.",

Due to Covid, multiple surgeries were canceled and rescheduled which conflicted with my appointment.  I had to reschedule as the surgery was the priority.  I left multiple messages (I have phone logs proving) to reschedule.  I did not receive a phone call back.  The day of my \"canceled\" appointment I received a message stating I was a \"no show\". I called, spoke with the receptionist Michelle and she was clueless.  Said she couldn't reschedule and had to speak with her Manager.  Long story short they sent me a letter stating they could no longer care for my medical needs.

When my mother refused to get chemotherapy treatment from him he basically casted us aside and was not willing to help out with any forms necessary to help us along the terrible journey that cancer takes you on. I took my mother out of the country to get treatment and the doctors were shocked when they saw her lab results and asked how could this have gone for so long without a diagnosis or treatment. My mom's suffering was heartbreaking when I left the country but after a month of foreign doctors treating her she was back to a painless life and enjoying the little time she had left. It's been over a year since I buried my mother and finally I decided to warn others not to take your loved ones to see this awful doctor. The reality is that death will come but why make your patients suffer when they have little time. Give them the care they need and treat them like humans deserve to be treated.

         "My son had outpatient dental surgery here about a year ago. We were there very early in the morning. Nurses, Anesthesiologist were very nice friendly and attentive. I cannot say the same for the Administration. I had our copay in hand and also had a medical card for the rest. The lady ran our payment on the card and did not do it right because it didn't go thru after that my card was blocked from payment. We were going to call but she said just make your cash payment and then when you get the bill pay the rest with the card that way you can call them and see why it didn't go thru. When I called they told me the mistake she made. After months I did receive the bill with the copay and coinsurance portion. I called to make payment plan. By this time I have no more benefits on our medical card left. I have been unable to make payments to them since we have so many medical bills for our son who has a condition that requires endless doctor visits. I receive final notice for my statement. I called to make plan to pay the amount in full when my benefits start again in may. They say they cannot hold the account there is nothing they can do and it will be sent to collections. All of these facilities want to get paid and i want to pay them but when it comes to just waiting one more month they never want to wait. I could of paid half of that  the day we were there but they made a mistake.  The admitting person even took less of a cash payment then what i had. I had an uneven amount and she said here how about I take $50 and bill you the rest. who says that? Just seemed like she doesn't know how to do her job. I have also had out patient surgery at Renown before our insurance changed and no issues with them at all. I will most definitely not go there anymore and might have to go out of network just to get better administrative service.",

         "Worst experience ever!! Scheduled for a eye operation with Dr. Hong (who was very helpful and great). Wallet was lost right before operation, needed ID to be able to go ahead with the surgery, even though the surgery had been paid for in cash! Ended up getting a different quote on the cost of the surgery center for out-patient procedure while arguing with the ladies at the front desk that the procedure had already been paid for in full! The administrator, a very mean lady refused to let us go back. Reason being ID was needed incase an ambulance had to be called, even though you don't have to be a citizen to ride in an ambulance. I doubt they'll check to make sure you have ID. Plus I could hear them talking about the patients information sitting in the waiting room; meaning everyone could hear them (HIPPA violation). Worst experience ever! Would NEVER recommend going there! And when we tried to explain we were not going through the insurance policy, they said we had to incase something happened to the patient in 6 months and needed to meet their deductible now (total bullshit, none of their business!). Terrible place and people!!",
