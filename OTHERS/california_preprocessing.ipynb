Matter of fact he is the one who pointed out the pool wasn't being treated right, and that the adjustment mechanism was even broken. He even told me my pump motor was on the outs and helped get a new one. You don't find to many people as friendly as Jerry either if he sees something wrong he well tell even if it's not pool related, example he pointed out we had a nest of bugs at our gate and was making another one bigger on our roof over hang. And his prices for his services are the best, for what he does they fit all that he does for the work. He also keeps us informed if anything that might be hurting our pool or equipment, example a tree by the pool is losing a lot of it's leaves. He suggested that it be removed because it's lost most of it leaves, and looks diseased, I am getting my Landscaper to look at it if so out comes. Besides the leaves are doing damage to the impaler in the pool pump, Great Outfit.",

My entire family and extended family goes to Oasis and had been for a few years so I figured I would give them a shot. I’m glad I did. They saved my teeth, they really did, and they make it really easy for me as someone who really hates going to the dentist. They’ve been fantastic. It’s been a few years now and my teeth are in good shape and it’s all down to them. I really appreciate and trust them. If you’re looking for a dentist, give Oasis a try, you won’t regret it. And if you haven’t been in a while or hate going to the dentist in general, this is certainly a great place to get started again and make sure your oral health is taken care of.",

She always takes time to answer any questions or concerns I have too. The office is a small, individual practice where my family feels known. Such a nice change from most huge corporate businesses where one feels like a number.\n\nWhen we moved to town having always been faithful with our every-6-month cleanings and check-ups in our old state, Dr. Huynh quickly identified small issues our old dentist had overlooked. This was hard to take at first, but I soon learned to trust her. We’re grateful she caught things that saved us bigger issues in the long-term. Now I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Highly recommend Oasis Dentistry.",

Matter of fact he is the one who pointed out the pool wasn't being treated right, and that the adjustment mechanism was even broken. He even told me my pump motor was on the outs and helped get a new one. You don't find to many people as friendly as Jerry either if he sees something wrong he well tell even if it's not pool related, example he pointed out we had a nest of bugs at our gate and was making another one bigger on our roof over hang. And his prices for his services are the best, for what he does they fit all that he does for the work. He also keeps us informed if anything that might be hurting our pool or equipment, example a tree by the pool is losing a lot of it's leaves. He suggested that it be removed because it's lost most of it leaves, and looks diseased, I am getting my Landscaper to look at it if so out comes. Besides the leaves are doing damage to the impaler in the pool pump, Great Outfit.",

My entire family and extended family goes to Oasis and had been for a few years so I figured I would give them a shot. I’m glad I did. They saved my teeth, they really did, and they make it really easy for me as someone who really hates going to the dentist. They’ve been fantastic. It’s been a few years now and my teeth are in good shape and it’s all down to them. I really appreciate and trust them. If you’re looking for a dentist, give Oasis a try, you won’t regret it. And if you haven’t been in a while or hate going to the dentist in general, this is certainly a great place to get started again and make sure your oral health is taken care of.",

Such a nice change from most huge corporate businesses where one feels like a number.\n\nWhen we moved to town having always been faithful with our every-6-month cleanings and check-ups in our old state, Dr. Huynh quickly identified small issues our old dentist had overlooked. This was hard to take at first, but I soon learned to trust her. We’re grateful she caught things that saved us bigger issues in the long-term. Now I wouldn’t go anywhere else.
