They actually took the time to listen and actually care. There are so many staff members whom may or may not still be there I'll never forget. Both times going I obtained friendships with phenomenal people!! I just can't say enough good about the place. I haven't released in almost 5 years! Great place to go if you're serious about sobriety.",

They are very efficient and Dr Lee is amazing. I had a chipped front tooth and Dr Lee got me in immediately and got my tooth looking brand new. I also didn't have a long wait time which was great. I would highly recommend this facility to everyone."

I’m a hobbyist drummer and I was worried my lack of sufficient ear protection had started to cause some damage. Dr. Fike came and got me from my car himself and throughout the entire appointment was super personable and easy to talk with. He made great recommendations on getting myself some proper hearing protection and I look forward to going back to get my custom fit.",
