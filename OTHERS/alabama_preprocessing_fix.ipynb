One week into the order they started contacting us asking us about the status of the furniture delivery and   on every occasion we reminded them that special ordered furniture can take up to sixteen weeks but we hoped it would arrive much sooner.  We kept them abreast of status and put a caveat during each daily call to us that we were forwarding them what we had been told from the manufacturer and shipping company.  WE GOT IT TO YOU IN A MONTH, and during the Christmas shipping backlogs and snow storm at the manufacturer!     We are sorry that you thought your brother and sister-in-law were mistreated.

I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I know for sure, I will NEVER shop there again though.",

We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people.

         "Ms Riley, I am sorry you feel your brother and sister-in-law were treated unfairly.  We showed you the contract your sister-in-law signed stating that it could take up to 16 weeks to take delivery of the special ordered furniture.  One week into the order they started contacting us asking us about the status of the furniture delivery and   on every occasion we reminded them that special ordered furniture can take up to sixteen weeks but we hoped it would arrive much sooner.  We kept them abreast of status and put a caveat during each daily call to us that we were forwarding them what we had been told from the manufacturer and shipping company.  WE GOT IT TO YOU IN A MONTH, and during the Christmas shipping backlogs and snow storm at the manufacturer!     We are sorry that you thought your brother and sister-in-law were mistreated.  We believe we went far beyond what is considered great customer service in making such a quick delivery.",

About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I know for sure, I will NEVER shop there again though.",

         "HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. WILL NEVER RETURN!!! My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people. A Nurturing Moment is a much better alternative. The woman there is very nice and polite and knowledgeable about the products she sells. To sum it up it was terrible experience.",

Further we told her that it was sold to her at a discount and we were very specific with her that it was not returnable.  In addition, the stroller smelled like cigarette smoke and we would not be able to re-sell it.  I am sorry your expectations were not the same as was your wife's.\"}",

I have never had anything but an amazing experience dealing with the owner and her staff.  The store is clean, well-organized, and there is always plenty to choose from.  It's specialty, one-of-a-kind stuff and always my first stop for hair bows/headbands and \"Special Occasion\" clothing & items.  Also, the Santa Pictures they do every year with Gallery Seven Photography is by far and away the BEST setup in Huntsville.  I know ladies who drive from Nashville to have their Christmas cards done at the store every year because the set and Santa are both so gorgeous!  Love this store and will continue to shop there!",

We showed you the contract your sister-in-law signed stating that it could take up to 16 weeks to take delivery of the special ordered furniture.  One week into the order they started contacting us asking us about the status of the furniture delivery and   on every occasion we reminded them that special ordered furniture can take up to sixteen weeks but we hoped it would arrive much sooner.  We kept them abreast of status and put a caveat during each daily call to us that we were forwarding them what we had been told from the manufacturer and shipping company.  WE GOT IT TO YOU IN A MONTH, and during the Christmas shipping backlogs and snow storm at the manufacturer!     We are sorry that you thought your brother and sister-in-law were mistreated.  We believe we went far beyond what is considered great customer service in making such a quick delivery.",

I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I know for sure, I will NEVER shop there again though.",

         "HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. WILL NEVER RETURN!!! My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people. A Nurturing Moment is a much better alternative. The woman there is very nice and polite and knowledgeable about the products she sells. To sum it up it was terrible experience.",

In addition, the stroller smelled like cigarette smoke and we would not be able to re-sell it.  I am sorry your expectations were not the same as was your wife's.\"}",

While my friends were complaining that their baby furniture deliveries (ordered from other local shops) were running weeks behind schedule, mine was in the nursery and ready to go! I have never had anything but an amazing experience dealing with the owner and her staff.  The store is clean, well-organized, and there is always plenty to choose from.  It's specialty, one-of-a-kind stuff and always my first stop for hair bows/headbands and \"Special Occasion\" clothing & items.  Also, the Santa Pictures they do every year with Gallery Seven Photography is by far and away the BEST setup in Huntsville.  I know ladies who drive from Nashville to have their Christmas cards done at the store every year because the set and Santa are both so gorgeous!  Love this store and will continue to shop there!",

         "*ATTENTION* Bad Customer Sevice ALERT!!!\nOn October 21, my wife(9 months pregnant) purchased a crib and double dresser from POSH MOMMY, located on Hwy 72 in Madison AL. The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, ‚Äòthat is not the way they do business‚Äô. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me ‚Äòthe truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.‚Äô I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa‚Äôs husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word. I guess that means nothing these days.#cribforJAX",

         "After reading all these reviews, I had to leave my experience on here. My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)",

They also carry a large assortment of bows of every color imaginable as well as all sorts of accessories. What really impressed me most was the friendliness of the owner and staff. Every one was wonderful.  I visited the boutique with two of my young grandchildren (I don‚Äôt know what I was thinkingüò≥) and the ladies were so helpful and even helped keep them busy while I shopped.  This boutique is my new go-to for future children‚Äôs purchases. Thank you ladies!",

We showed you the contract your sister-in-law signed stating that it could take up to 16 weeks to take delivery of the special ordered furniture.  One week into the order they started contacting us asking us about the status of the furniture delivery and   on every occasion we reminded them that special ordered furniture can take up to sixteen weeks but we hoped it would arrive much sooner.  We kept them abreast of status and put a caveat during each daily call to us that we were forwarding them what we had been told from the manufacturer and shipping company.  WE GOT IT TO YOU IN A MONTH, and during the Christmas shipping backlogs and snow storm at the manufacturer!     We are sorry that you thought your brother and sister-in-law were mistreated.

Posh Mommy however assured them that the furniture could be delivered in a few weeks. My nephew was born Nov. 16th and as of today Nov. 21st, no furniture has arrived.  Over the past few weeks my brother has made several attempts to get a delivery date for the purchased furniture to no avail.  The owners have chosen to be rude, verbally aggressive, and dishonest with all communication after payment was received. The owners have shown my family such poor customer service that I would NEVER refer anyone to shop at Posh Mommy. For first time parents, selecting and buying furniture should be joyous but Posh Mommy turned it into a nightmare.",

I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I know for sure, I will NEVER shop there again though.",

         "HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. WILL NEVER RETURN!!! My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people. A Nurturing Moment is a much better alternative. The woman there is very nice and polite and knowledgeable about the products she sells. To sum it up it was terrible experience.",
         "{'time': 1573754533461, 'text': \"Mr Brosemer, as we talked at the time, the stroller your wife purchased at time had been used by her outside the store, we personally witnessed her using it.  Further we told her that it was sold to her at a discount and we were very specific with her that it was not returnable.  In addition, the stroller smelled like cigarette smoke and we would not be able to re-sell it.  I am sorry your expectations were not the same as was your wife's.\"}",

I have never had anything but an amazing experience dealing with the owner and her staff.  The store is clean, well-organized, and there is always plenty to choose from.  It's specialty, one-of-a-kind stuff and always my first stop for hair bows/headbands and \"Special Occasion\" clothing & items.  Also, the Santa Pictures they do every year with Gallery Seven Photography is by far and away the BEST setup in Huntsville.

         "*ATTENTION* Bad Customer Sevice ALERT!!!\nOn October 21, my wife(9 months pregnant) purchased a crib and double dresser from POSH MOMMY, located on Hwy 72 in Madison AL. The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, ‚Äòthat is not the way they do business‚Äô. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me ‚Äòthe truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.‚Äô I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa‚Äôs husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word. I guess that means nothing these days.#cribforJAX",

         "After reading all these reviews, I had to leave my experience on here. My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)",

One week into the order they started contacting us asking us about the status of the furniture delivery and   on every occasion we reminded them that special ordered furniture can take up to sixteen weeks but we hoped it would arrive much sooner.  We kept them abreast of status and put a caveat during each daily call to us that we were forwarding them what we had been told from the manufacturer and shipping company.  WE GOT IT TO YOU IN A MONTH, and during the Christmas shipping backlogs and snow storm at the manufacturer!     We are sorry that you thought your brother and sister-in-law were mistreated.

The owners have chosen to be rude, verbally aggressive, and dishonest with all communication after payment was received.

I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.

         "HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. WILL NEVER RETURN!!! My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people. A Nurturing Moment is a much better alternative. The woman there is very nice and polite and knowledgeable about the products she sells. To sum it up it was terrible experience.",
         "{'time': 1573754533461, 'text': \"Mr Brosemer, as we talked at the time, the stroller your wife purchased at time had been used by her outside the store, we personally witnessed her using it.  Further we told her that it was sold to her at a discount and we were very specific with her that it was not returnable.  In addition, the stroller smelled like cigarette smoke and we would not be able to re-sell it.  I am sorry your expectations were not the same as was your wife's.\"}",

While my friends were complaining that their baby furniture deliveries (ordered from other local shops) were running weeks behind schedule, mine was in the nursery and ready to go! I have never had anything but an amazing experience dealing with the owner and her staff.  The store is clean, well-organized, and there is always plenty to choose from.  It's specialty, one-of-a-kind stuff and always my first stop for hair bows/headbands and \"Special Occasion\" clothing & items.  Also, the Santa Pictures they do every year with Gallery Seven Photography is by far and away the BEST setup in Huntsville.  I know ladies who drive from Nashville to have their Christmas cards done at the store every year because the set and Santa are both so gorgeous!  Love this store and will continue to shop there!",

         "*ATTENTION* Bad Customer Sevice ALERT!!!\nOn October 21, my wife(9 months pregnant) purchased a crib and double dresser from POSH MOMMY, located on Hwy 72 in Madison AL. The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, ‚Äòthat is not the way they do business‚Äô. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me ‚Äòthe truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.‚Äô I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa‚Äôs husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word. I guess that means nothing these days.#cribforJAX",

This is driven by many reasons, all attributable to the manufacturer, be it that furniture is in production, frequently overseas, shipment from overseas, tied up in customs, delivery warehouse problems, etc.  We work our very best to make customers happy but unfortunately in this situation, your expectations did not line up with the contract.'}",

         "After reading all these reviews, I had to leave my experience on here. My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)",

They also carry a large assortment of bows of every color imaginable as well as all sorts of accessories. What really impressed me most was the friendliness of the owner and staff. Every one was wonderful.  I visited the boutique with two of my young grandchildren (I don‚Äôt know what I was thinkingüò≥) and the ladies were so helpful and even helped keep them busy while I shopped.  This boutique is my new go-to for future children‚Äôs purchases. Thank you ladies!",

         "Ms Riley, I am sorry you feel your brother and sister-in-law were treated unfairly.  We showed you the contract your sister-in-law signed stating that it could take up to 16 weeks to take delivery of the special ordered furniture.  One week into the order they started contacting us asking us about the status of the furniture delivery and   on every occasion we reminded them that special ordered furniture can take up to sixteen weeks but we hoped it would arrive much sooner.  We kept them abreast of status and put a caveat during each daily call to us that we were forwarding them what we had been told from the manufacturer and shipping company.  WE GOT IT TO YOU IN A MONTH, and during the Christmas shipping backlogs and snow storm at the manufacturer!     We are sorry that you thought your brother and sister-in-law were mistreated.  We believe we went far beyond what is considered great customer service in making such a quick delivery.",

Over the past few weeks my brother has made several attempts to get a delivery date for the purchased furniture to no avail.  The owners have chosen to be rude, verbally aggressive, and dishonest with all communication after payment was received. The owners have shown my family such poor customer service that I would NEVER refer anyone to shop at Posh Mommy.

I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I know for sure, I will NEVER shop there again though.",

         "HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. WILL NEVER RETURN!!! My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people. A Nurturing Moment is a much better alternative. The woman there is very nice and polite and knowledgeable about the products she sells. To sum it up it was terrible experience.",
         "{'time': 1573754533461, 'text': \"Mr Brosemer, as we talked at the time, the stroller your wife purchased at time had been used by her outside the store, we personally witnessed her using it.  Further we told her that it was sold to her at a discount and we were very specific with her that it was not returnable.  In addition, the stroller smelled like cigarette smoke and we would not be able to re-sell it.  I am sorry your expectations were not the same as was your wife's.\"}",

I have never had anything but an amazing experience dealing with the owner and her staff.  The store is clean, well-organized, and there is always plenty to choose from.  It's specialty, one-of-a-kind stuff and always my first stop for hair bows/headbands and \"Special Occasion\" clothing & items.  Also, the Santa Pictures they do every year with Gallery Seven Photography is by far and away the BEST setup in Huntsville.

         "*ATTENTION* Bad Customer Sevice ALERT!!!\nOn October 21, my wife(9 months pregnant) purchased a crib and double dresser from POSH MOMMY, located on Hwy 72 in Madison AL. The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, ‚Äòthat is not the way they do business‚Äô. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me ‚Äòthe truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.‚Äô I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa‚Äôs husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word. I guess that means nothing these days.#cribforJAX",

This is driven by many reasons, all attributable to the manufacturer, be it that furniture is in production, frequently overseas, shipment from overseas, tied up in customs, delivery warehouse problems, etc.  We work our very best to make customers happy but unfortunately in this situation, your expectations did not line up with the contract.'}",

         "After reading all these reviews, I had to leave my experience on here. My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)",

The nursing staff is wonderful and accomodating. The ED has been updating the building and it looks very nice. Zero odors, ever. The food is good and hot when delivered on halls as staff completes test trays often to ensure palatability. The Food and Nutrition Manager is always implementing new programs to make the residents feel at home -- ice cream socials, homemade bread to make the dining room smell good, omelet and waffle stations.

They had wrestled it away from him injuring (cutting)his finger and bruising him. They said that he kept pushing the button. Totally unacceptable. When I left the night before at 9 pm, I left his cell phone along with a pad that had my number and my brothers written down on the tray table next to his bed. When I got there, both had been moved to a desk in his room that again he couldn‚Äôt reach. I would hire a sitter if your loved one is ever has to be in this facility, especially at night. Beware of the night nurses. I have names of them if needed.",

We told them from the beginning that we had gotten a 30-day notice from the assisted living facility to complete the transfer. Dedra, the admissions director, was never in when we called and never returned even ONE of my more than a dozen phone calls. When I went to the facility in person, she was never there and her assistant, Paula, acted as if she was bored to tears by everything I said and could not have cared less about our problems. Finally, when we were on day 24 of our 30 days and Dedra still had not done the face-to-face interview with my MIL to determine if they could take her, we gave up and chose another nursing home. I've known people who had relatives at Mobile Nursing and Rehab who were very happy with the nursing care, but the administration and admissions personnel are terrible. They made an already painful and stressful time for us even worse.",

My mother was in a halo of rine and there were no supplies in the room, she is a tube feeder and the aid tried to put her head down all the way until I reminder her that she was a tube feeder and that wasnt suppose to happen, no gloves no barrier and the trash was over flowing, the TV was off and lights were off in the room, I'd not recommend this facility to anyone other than the state and that would be under the suggestion to shut them down, VERY POOR QUALITY OF CARE BEWARE!!!",

If I'd known I'd get turned away for my 6-month-old's eye appointment, I would have saved myself the trouble when I knew I wouldn't make it on time because of traffic. They should tell you that if you don't get there exactly on time that you might as well not show up at all. Warning to moms: don't drag your cranky kid to this place unless you can guarantee all things will go right on the way there. Thanks for helping me waste an hour of my life and patience.
