Currently,  if you pay with cash, you get a 4% discount.\nWe will return to try other mouth watering burritos and specialties from the menu soon.\nThe only suggestion I can think of is that someone needs to post a sign on the corner of Missouri St and Thompson. \"Mitchell's Breakfast Burritos\" under the name in BIG BOLD Red letters it should say, \"OPEN\", with an arrow pointing the way.

Our order was up in no time at all. The burritos are excellent and worth the price. Currently,  if you pay with cash, you get a 4% discount.\nWe will return to try other mouth watering burritos and specialties from the menu soon.\nThe only suggestion I can think of is that someone needs to post a sign on the corner of Missouri St and Thompson. \"Mitchell's Breakfast Burritos\" under the name in BIG BOLD Red letters it should say, \"OPEN\", with an arrow pointing the way. If it weren't for searching Google for restaurants, hard saying how long it may have been before learning of the business.\nPlease go and enjoy! Best and biggest burritos I've seen in town.",

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

He advised that I go to Pat Walker to seek help and I set an appointment.\n\nI waited about two weeks. I set an appointment for 10am, but apparently that means your appointment is for 9:30am for paperwork (it must be enough paperwork for a house purchase!).\n\nThe morning of, I left my house early and arrived at the campus at 9:30am. Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

         "Don’t go to CAPS. I was left completely unsatisfied by the care I received from my CAPS psychiatrist during my senior year. I left her care in worse shape than when I first saw her. I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

I set an appointment for 10am, but apparently that means your appointment is for 9:30am for paperwork (it must be enough paperwork for a house purchase!).\n\nThe morning of, I left my house early and arrived at the campus at 9:30am. Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

         "The CAPS Program:\n\nI’ve battled depression for years after my brother passed away and even my professor expressed concern because I was missing class due to it. He advised that I go to Pat Walker to seek help and I set an appointment.\n\nI waited about two weeks. I set an appointment for 10am, but apparently that means your appointment is for 9:30am for paperwork (it must be enough paperwork for a house purchase!).\n\nThe morning of, I left my house early and arrived at the campus at 9:30am. Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

         "This place is a complete JOKE!!!! I have been there 3 times. The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

I'm giving 4 stars because the MD had good bedside manner, was thorough (still waiting on a referral however), and checked up on me through the patient portal website. The phlebotomist did a good job- he drew 5+ vials of blood and I barely felt it since he did a pretty good job making chit chat to distract me. My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill. Granted, I had to make an appointment and I waited a loonggggg time to be seen, but I was much more comfortable with the competency of those around me.",

But I had bad experiences with CAPS, particularly their greediness and lack of really understanding. Not to mention their use of grad students as counselors. Find good mental health counselors can be hard, and CAPS is not the place for it.\n\nEdited a year and half later:\nI discovered I'm trans and there were plenty of chances for the 3 different counselors I met with to help me figure this out. Instead I went through a hell of suicidal thoughts and depression before finally figuring it out for myself. Shout out to Ryan Burchfield and Meghan Werner. These two community counselors (in Rogers and Fayetteville, respectively) helped me a ton.

The office is awkwardly setup and I looked around, there was no one in the office. I took a seat in the office, noticed there was an Arlo camera in the corner, I felt better about not seeing anyone because Arlo sends notifications to your phone to let you know when motion was detected.  Sat there for probably 45 mins or so with no movement in the office, I finally called 20 mins or so after my appointment was supposed to start. After two awkward holds I was asked to reschedule. Didn’t reschedule. They had three clocks in the office, two set to different times and the one in the waiting room was stopped, ironic?",
