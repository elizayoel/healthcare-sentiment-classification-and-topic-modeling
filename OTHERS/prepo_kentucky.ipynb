The cleaning staff is non existent , the room that I visit the walls are covered with dirt and dust, there is constant dirty towels, and dirty wipes on the floor. I constantly have to call in for the nurses or aids to help the person that my family has there, idk if is because there is not enough people, or because they are not responding to patients. And when I do call, and I have to a few times for me to even get an answer, I have been hanged up on, I have been constantly placed on hold. They have changed management, yes, but things haven't improved at all. Its like the place is on limbo. I have gone to visit, and no one answers the door bell, I have to call in, especially on weekends, there is no one in the office at all, and especially on the weekends, no one answers the phones. And yes I will be placing an official complaint with pictures. I haven't seen abuse or neglect, that is not at all. But they do have to get their stuff together because they are a mess.",

I actually went in the next day and they raised it by $3000.00  the room they offered for nearly $8000.00 a month was shared by 3 . This place has some rooms 3 persons per room. Admissions takes me to a dark room. 1 lady who had the window side was curled into a ball looking frightened by us being there , remember ,  this room is a 3 person with only curtains divided. The center area would've been my mother's so called bed . And my point is that. ..it was only a tiny bed with a curtain on each side.  No side table nowhere to have any personal things. No room for me to even walk beside the bed. Ok so the admissions is showing me IN THE DARK,  we pass the lady's area in the room which is by the door....the admissions lady says \"I hope your mom doesn't mind,  but this lady doesn't like lights so hope your mom doesn't mind the dark!\" .WOW !! 8,000.00 A MONTH AND NO LIGHTS AND NO TV . it WAS a CONCENTRATION CAMP.  my mom has lost of living to do, so I figured this place is a crypt for those who want to or are on verge of dying.  My mother would give up here . So need less to say . We left and never looked back.",

I choose this place because of reviews and it was the closest place to my location that would allow me to pick up my child during lunch time. I was told the first time that they needed to check their classrooms and would call me back the next day. Days went by and at the end of the week I called back. No answer, left a message, no call back. Called again a couple days later and the woman I spoke with before told me and I quote \"well right after you called, someone else called and they where enrolled here previously.....\" basically, she gave the availability to someone else that she knows and couldn't be bothered to call me back. Said she had to check their census again and would call me back. Never did. Thanks for wasting my time while my child falls further behind. Extremely unprofessional. Note. After checking further reviews, I found out I'm not the only one they have done this to recently",

         "I have never left a bad review in my life, but the way we were treated and the service we were provided was appalling. We had just moved to Elizabethtown and we couldn’t find a new refrigerator to buy, everything was on back order due to Covid so after almost two weeks with no refrigerator we decided to get one second hand. After working for two days it stopped working and our food was spoiled. I looked up to see a LOCAL company that had good reviews and found Speedy Appliance. I called and was thrilled when they said they could have someone out the same day! When they looked at it they told us it was the “ mother board “, and that it would be 500.00 for the part and labor, I was upset as this was more than we had paid for the refrigerator itself. But knowing how hard it had been to find a new refrigerator I paid in full using Zelle as requested by the company and was just glad to have a refrigerator again. I was hosting a baby shower the coming weekend and had to have a refrigerator.  We were told that the part would be in and installed several days later. The day of instillation we were called at 11:30 am and told the part Just Arrived, so he couldn’t get to it for several days..... it’s morning, we are nice and just say....that’s fine. He came as he was supposed to the next time. The refrigerator worked! Off to the store we go spending hundreds of dollars on food, for us and the party. The fridge worked for less than 48 hours! I opened it and it was 67 degrees. I called Speedy and they said they could get someone out the next day. So my husband goes and buys coolers and Ice trying to save our food. He does everything he can think of and still can’t get it to work. The next day we were called and told there was a “family emergency “ and they would have someone out Monday! My party was on Sunday. I have to host a baby shower, doing all the food myself with no refrigerator. There was no call on Monday.... no one came....no one answered the phone! When we call on Tuesday they said they couldn’t have anyone come till Thursday!!!! I was furious. I told them not to bother! They have now cost me hundreds more than I paid them, between food spoiled, coolers and most importantly just the complete inconvenience! I can’t dispute the 500, because I Used Zelle so I’m looking into small claims court and calling the better business bureau. Needless to say it was a horrific experience and I hope I can save someone else from going through it!",

Naturally we honked the horn he pulled into our neighborhood but blocked us to where we could not drive around. He then got out of his truck and approached our car and the driver side window. In the car were 3 women and a kid. I think the man got more than he bargained for because there were 2 strong willed women in the car. He finally got in his truck and moved. However, he then proceeded to follow us to our house and record us. All of this because he thought we were driving too fast (we were speeding up to get around him because he was driving in the median refusing to let us over)...I assured he was not law enforcement (not that I ever thought he was) and why he was so concerned with our speed and why he thought this was necessary. Use caution when using this company so aggressive, unnecessary, unprofessional and predatory. The male was white and appeared to be in his 50s with gray/white hair, medium/chubby stature driving a white box truck with “Ball and Ball Trucking” on the back in blue. This happened in Shepherdsville, KY. around 4:15pm on 1/9/21.",

New leadership includes Master’s and Bachelor’s prepared nurses with certifications in stroke, emergency care, and IV therapy. Staff retention is improving. Rehires are amazed at the change in atmosphere. May 2021 30 day post-acute (new admission) readmission rates were ZERO PERCENT!

The cleaning staff is non existent , the room that I visit the walls are covered with dirt and dust, there is constant dirty towels, and dirty wipes on the floor. I constantly have to call in for the nurses or aids to help the person that my family has there, idk if is because there is not enough people, or because they are not responding to patients. And when I do call, and I have to a few times for me to even get an answer, I have been hanged up on, I have been constantly placed on hold. They have changed management, yes, but things haven't improved at all. Its like the place is on limbo. I have gone to visit, and no one answers the door bell, I have to call in, especially on weekends, there is no one in the office at all, and especially on the weekends, no one answers the phones.

What I find interesting is that most these reviews focus on the negative and don’t shed light on all of the positive they do. The Administration is extremely positive and always tried to meet the needs of their residents. Diane,The administrator, is a caring and compassionate individual. The nurses always treated the residents with respect and helped them  facilitate any needs they had. Keep in mind that I no longer work for this company. I just can not agree with many of the negative reviews this place gets. I enjoyed working there and miss the staff and the residents I once worked with. They were great people. Keep in mind that every facility has its issues. While I had my own personal issues with said company I will never say that it is a bad place. They focus on healing and contribute to the healing process. Many of the residents would tell you that the staff is like a second family.\nJonah",

New leadership includes Master’s and Bachelor’s prepared nurses with certifications in stroke, emergency care, and IV therapy. Staff retention is improving. Rehires are amazed at the change in atmosphere. May 2021 30 day post-acute (new admission) readmission rates were ZERO PERCENT!

The cleaning staff is non existent , the room that I visit the walls are covered with dirt and dust, there is constant dirty towels, and dirty wipes on the floor. I constantly have to call in for the nurses or aids to help the person that my family has there, idk if is because there is not enough people, or because they are not responding to patients. And when I do call, and I have to a few times for me to even get an answer, I have been hanged up on, I have been constantly placed on hold. They have changed management, yes, but things haven't improved at all. Its like the place is on limbo. I have gone to visit, and no one answers the door bell, I have to call in, especially on weekends, there is no one in the office at all, and especially on the weekends, no one answers the phones. And yes I will be placing an official complaint with pictures. I haven't seen abuse or neglect, that is not at all. But they do have to get their stuff together because they are a mess.",

What I find interesting is that most these reviews focus on the negative and don’t shed light on all of the positive they do. The Administration is extremely positive and always tried to meet the needs of their residents. Diane,The administrator, is a caring and compassionate individual. The nurses always treated the residents with respect and helped them  facilitate any needs they had. Keep in mind that I no longer work for this company. I just can not agree with many of the negative reviews this place gets. I enjoyed working there and miss the staff and the residents I once worked with. They were great people. Keep in mind that every facility has its issues. While I had my own personal issues with said company I will never say that it is a bad place. They focus on healing and contribute to the healing process. Many of the residents would tell you that the staff is like a second family.\nJonah",

Admissions takes me to a dark room. 1 lady who had the window side was curled into a ball looking frightened by us being there , remember ,  this room is a 3 person with only curtains divided. The center area would've been my mother's so called bed . And my point is that. ..it was only a tiny bed with a curtain on each side.  No side table nowhere to have any personal things. No room for me to even walk beside the bed. Ok so the admissions is showing me IN THE DARK,  we pass the lady's area in the room which is by the door....the admissions lady says \"I hope your mom doesn't mind,  but this lady doesn't like lights so hope your mom doesn't mind the dark!\" .WOW !! 8,000.00 A MONTH AND NO LIGHTS AND NO TV . it WAS a CONCENTRATION CAMP.  my mom has lost of living to do, so I figured this place is a crypt for those who want to or are on verge of dying.
