         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

         "Don’t go to CAPS. I was left completely unsatisfied by the care I received from my CAPS psychiatrist during my senior year. I left her care in worse shape than when I first saw her. I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

Luckily her sister was in town that night and stopped in to see her.  She took her to the emergency room because she was concerned.  Long story short, we spent the next 29 days in the hospital fighting bacterial meningitis!  And after all that, they sent us a bill for their service!  Had to pay because they will hold your grades, and you have to turn in your grades by a certain date to keep your scholarship!  1 Star is too high for this place, but you can’t leave a review without giving them that!",

I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill.

         "Regency Center has evolved leaps and bounds in the last 120 days under new leadership. Recent deficiency free Infection Control survey, and the current DON walked flawlessly through the last inspection with no tags related to any care given under her direction. Even the surveyors COMPLEMENTED the team on the vast improvements in just a little over 100 days! New leadership includes Master’s and Bachelor’s prepared nurses with certifications in stroke, emergency care, and IV therapy. Staff retention is improving. Rehires are amazed at the change in atmosphere. May 2021 30 day post-acute (new admission) readmission rates were ZERO PERCENT! Regency Center has set the bar high and is flying to the top! #teamregency",

They are severely understaffed, so much that they don't have maintenance person, if they do, is for a limited amount of time. The cleaning staff is non existent , the room that I visit the walls are covered with dirt and dust, there is constant dirty towels, and dirty wipes on the floor. I constantly have to call in for the nurses or aids to help the person that my family has there, idk if is because there is not enough people, or because they are not responding to patients. And when I do call, and I have to a few times for me to even get an answer, I have been hanged up on, I have been constantly placed on hold. They have changed management, yes, but things haven't improved at all. Its like the place is on limbo. I have gone to visit, and no one answers the door bell, I have to call in, especially on weekends, there is no one in the office at all, and especially on the weekends, no one answers the phones. And yes I will be placing an official complaint with pictures. I haven't seen abuse or neglect, that is not at all. But they do have to get their stuff together because they are a mess.",

What I find interesting is that most these reviews focus on the negative and don’t shed light on all of the positive they do. The Administration is extremely positive and always tried to meet the needs of their residents. Diane,The administrator, is a caring and compassionate individual. The nurses always treated the residents with respect and helped them  facilitate any needs they had. Keep in mind that I no longer work for this company. I just can not agree with many of the negative reviews this place gets. I enjoyed working there and miss the staff and the residents I once worked with. They were great people. Keep in mind that every facility has its issues. While I had my own personal issues with said company I will never say that it is a bad place. They focus on healing and contribute to the healing process. Many of the residents would tell you that the staff is like a second family.\nJonah",

I actually went in the next day and they raised it by $3000.00  the room they offered for nearly $8000.00 a month was shared by 3 . This place has some rooms 3 persons per room. Admissions takes me to a dark room. 1 lady who had the window side was curled into a ball looking frightened by us being there , remember ,  this room is a 3 person with only curtains divided. The center area would've been my mother's so called bed . And my point is that. ..it was only a tiny bed with a curtain on each side.  No side table nowhere to have any personal things. No room for me to even walk beside the bed. Ok so the admissions is showing me IN THE DARK,  we pass the lady's area in the room which is by the door....the admissions lady says \"I hope your mom doesn't mind,  but this lady doesn't like lights so hope your mom doesn't mind the dark!\" .WOW !! 8,000.00 A MONTH AND NO LIGHTS AND NO TV . it WAS a CONCENTRATION CAMP.  my mom has lost of living to do, so I figured this place is a crypt for those who want to or are on verge of dying.  My mother would give up here . So need less to say . We left and never looked back.",

She simply quoted her standard, Medicare, \"book, chapter and verse\" to me, because Medicare had provided me a mobility scooter (which lives in my car for use outside the home  because i am unable to get it into, or out OF, the house)... despite me telling her in detail what medicare told me, and that medicare said that I was correct in believing that I was qualified for a new manual chair because of its age (6 years).\n\nSHE said, that SHE didn't know WHY MEDICARE would have TOLD me that.  Ummmmmmmm... MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE MEDICARE!?!?!?\n\nShe says she discussed the issue of my claim with her manager... and within an hour called me back to say that she \"couldn't write the claim for this chair.\"\n\nDid she BOTHER to CALL MEDICARE to VERIFY the veracity of my claim?  Did ANYONE CALL Medicare to check my account for the RECORD of my lengthy conversation with them, wherein they explained WHY the claim would be honored?  Evidently NOT. They couldn't be bothered to verify my statement? Make one call?\n\nFrom where I sit, a 50 YO paraplegic in a rotting, creaky, decrepit chair--- they don't appear inclined to go the extra mile for a potential new client.  I have many, many, medical equipment needs, but I'll send to TEXAS, before I buy anything from these people.  What if it was one of their friends or family (God forbid)?\n\nEver so helpful, she gleefully chirped that she'd be HAPPY to sell me a USED (\"It's almost like NEW!\") manual wheelchair... for SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN dollars, and twenty cents.  I wonder if she actually heard herself SAY that?\n\nMedicare. Disability. #duh.  Just. wow.",

I have had pets misdiagnosed, they have run out of medicine when my dog was being treated for a life threatening case of Blastomycosis, I have had a vet refuse to come back to answer a question, I have had a vet there try to give my dog a med that was contraindicated for her .This was the last straw. I have been a client there for 23 years. Dr Betty used to own the clinic and it was fantastic but now I will never go back after the way I was treated.After Katrina, I recommended this clinic to everybody I know that moved to the Northshore. Now I am telling them about my recent bad experience and the are moving on to a different clinic as well.I know other people who are having the same problems so they must be paying their friends to give them 5 star reviews.",

The next day they refused to discharge her to an accepting accredited long term facility. She has a roommate that snores loudly making sleep impossible. She was told by a nurse to put two chairs together and sleep on that in the common area. The Doctor and Psychiatrist will not be treating her long term but yet they insisted she stay for more treatment. It’s all about money. They are not there to help anyone.

I never even met the girlfriend so she had no business listening in on my conversation. I left  message for her supervisor twice & once for her & no one returns my calls.

There's some shady and illegal things going on here, including something called \"TPMF\" or True Pop Me Friend, which must be VERY illegal. The premise of a TPMF is that you and another person each have a rubber band on your wrist and both parties pull the rubber band far back, though not to the point that the rubber band breaks. Both then release the band, and after a little while of this, one of the veins in your wrist is revealed and something behind it bursts, which the doctors then proceed to let bleed out.

They never contacted my therapist or psychiatrist, which they should have. They had two separate sexual incidents while I was there that the techs did not report, rather bragged and joked about it.

This place has gone to hell in a handbasket. Left early because I was being harassed and the meetings are not monitored. It's like blind leading the blind in the 28 day program. I am doing much better out in the world just doing IOP and AA. Not a good rehab. Too much fighting and arguing and no one does anything about it.

It takes time to work up to what we do and get comfortable with the routine, so we always recommend that you continue coming back to enhance your skill.

I didn't know how to wrap my hands and they kindly did it for me.  I'm still trying t figure out how to wrap my hands, but the employees there are very patient with me.  They have no problem helping me out.  When the class started I was nervous that I would be behind.  Again, the worries went away.  The instructors were amazing and also patient.  If I my form was off, they'd come by and show me.  After that first class, I didn't even hesitate to become a member of the Title Boxing Club family.  The price is a bit steep, but in my opinion it is worth it.  The facility is clean and organized.  I would recommend this to a friend and I recommend it to you.  The instructors are funny, energetic, patient, kind and very talented.  If you are considering joining a boxing club or facility I recommend this one.  Though the price is a bit steep, it is better than others I've looked at for sure.",

         "I was delighted to find a boxing/kickboxing gym in this part of Baltimore County as it was previously unavailable.  Compared to other martial arts studios in the area the classes are much more flexible and affordable. The gym facility is always clean and inviting.  The coaches and front desk staff are all very welcoming, nice and knowledgable.  The coaches let you work at your own pace while encouraging you to take it to the next level and cater to all skill levels. The classes run throughout the whole day so theres a time slot convenient for everyone.  They provide gloves for those just starting out so you dont have to invest before you decide to join ( but you will). The workout you will get here is incredible stress relief and will make you want to come back day after day. And overall they make it really easy for you to come out, have a good experience, and make sure you're comfortable and having fun.\n\nBefore joining title I was not active at all.  Since joining in April I've consistently come back day after day because the community here is so encouraging and provides a sense of accountability.  It's not just a gym that you'll walk into, workout,  and leave without anyone noticing.\n\nYou'll come for the workout and stay for the community.  If you're considering it, come out and try a class and you'll know what everyone is raving about.   Joining this gym was one of the best decisions I've made this year and I cant wait to continue to see the positive mental and physical changes these workouts provide for me.",

Then wait another 15 to 20 minutes, then see another assistant who does vision test, then another wait, then yet another assistant who does more tests/scans, then another wait. Finally, you see the doctor who, instead of showing g you your scans and interpreting their meaning,  reads them in another room and simply announces to you the results. After seeing one of a gaggle  of doctors, you are directed to the cashier window where you are told the total owed, after insurance, but no one shows or gives you a billing breakdown so you can see what cost what. In sum, I feel not like an individual patient that gets individual attention, but like a head in the herd being led from one station to another and finally the collection. Staff ARE cordial and friendly, but it still feels like a slick run-em-thru-the-stations business operation (timing out at 2.5 hours).  I'll be looking for another ophthalmologist's office where I feel more like a patient than a dollar sign.",

         "So awful. Expect to be here at least 2.5 hours including the 30-45 minutes you will wait AFTER your appointment time until they actually take you back.  I have been here 3 times just because I wanted to establish some kind of relationship with a doctor and staff who were also closer to my home. I have a bad reaction to the glaucoma testing drops and the numbing drops.  I have had to tell the tech each time I visited that I CANNOT have those drops. Scary that I have to  remind them each and  every time that I have allergic reactions to these drops because they do not take  the time to read my chart. I saw Dr. Thatch the first 2 times and he was \"ok\". I saw Dr. Hollifield the 3rd time and this man was so unprofessional and condescending. And when I told him he was hurting me while using that glass with the light to view the back of my eye he just rolled his eyes and claimed \"Well, this is how I do it\". Seriously? They also gave me an incorrect diagnosis. I now have a new opthalmologist who is on the other side of town and well worth the drive! She treated me with respect and concern and saw me at my appointment time and when she looked in the back of my eye, she did NOT hurt me. I will never go back to Retina Consultants. Such an awful experience.",

I waited a significant amount of time. While waiting for their staff to attend to me, I had the urge to use the restroom. I notified the receptionist and she told me I would be seen shortly and I had to wait to use the restroom, I sat back down and waited for a while longer. Finally it got to the point where I was about to piss on the floor in front of them so I went up to the window a second time and let the receptionist know I really couldn’t hold it any longer. Miraculously they suddenly had someone take me back and I was able to relieve myself. The staff continued to treat me poorly, for people who work in the health care industry they really don’t have the adequate people skills or professionalism. The “doctor” didn’t even greet me or mention his name, he just got right to it and treated me like a common criminal, the way I was treated almost would amount to malpractice. I think every staff member needs to be re trained on properly dealing with patients. My experience was so poor I wish I could give them -5 stars. They couldn’t even perform a simple blood draw correctly, Now I have a huge hematoma on my arm since staff can’t even draw blood correctly. Poor treatment, poor customer service, rude, unprofessional and incompetent staff. It’s amazing you haven’t been sued for malpractice yet.",

         "Keep looking!  Do not settle just because you can get an appointment.  There are much better out there, who truly care about the patients, IMO.  The staff and doctor go through the motions and its just a business.  Do not leave messages as they do not return calls.  I had other medical issues which required surgery.  Due to Covid, multiple surgeries were canceled and rescheduled which conflicted with my appointment.  I had to reschedule as the surgery was the priority.  I left multiple messages (I have phone logs proving) to reschedule.  I did not receive a phone call back.  The day of my \"canceled\" appointment I received a message stating I was a \"no show\". I called, spoke with the receptionist Michelle and she was clueless.  Said she couldn't reschedule and had to speak with her Manager.  Long story short they sent me a letter stating they could no longer care for my medical needs.  This was a blessing in disguise as I have found a wonderful, caring, knowledgeable doctor that actually listens to me and treats the disease.  KEEP LOOKING, DON'T SETTLE!",

Three visits, two medications tried and failed to address my excruciating joint pain. He offered nothing else, no other tests or labs, no other medications...said I should see my primary care. Really?! The same primary care doctor who said I needed a rheumatologist?\nFrankly I think the only reason he keeps his office open is so his daughter can legally do med spa stuff out of his office.\nDon't waste your time if you need a diagnosis or you are in pain. Dr. O'Hanlan does not care about you and will not help you.",

         "Dr. Kashef treated my mother like a fly on the wall not once did he ever greet her. He took 6 months to diagnose her bone cancer. When my mother refused to get chemotherapy treatment from him he basically casted us aside and was not willing to help out with any forms necessary to help us along the terrible journey that cancer takes you on. I took my mother out of the country to get treatment and the doctors were shocked when they saw her lab results and asked how could this have gone for so long without a diagnosis or treatment. My mom's suffering was heartbreaking when I left the country but after a month of foreign doctors treating her she was back to a painless life and enjoying the little time she had left. It's been over a year since I buried my mother and finally I decided to warn others not to take your loved ones to see this awful doctor. The reality is that death will come but why make your patients suffer when they have little time. Give them the care they need and treat them like humans deserve to be treated. Dr. KASHEF PLEASE RETIRE I'VE NEVER MET A DR AS TERRIBLE AS YOURSELF.",

I cannot say the same for the Administration. I had our copay in hand and also had a medical card for the rest. The lady ran our payment on the card and did not do it right because it didn't go thru after that my card was blocked from payment. We were going to call but she said just make your cash payment and then when you get the bill pay the rest with the card that way you can call them and see why it didn't go thru. When I called they told me the mistake she made. After months I did receive the bill with the copay and coinsurance portion. I called to make payment plan. By this time I have no more benefits on our medical card left. I have been unable to make payments to them since we have so many medical bills for our son who has a condition that requires endless doctor visits. I receive final notice for my statement. I called to make plan to pay the amount in full when my benefits start again in may. They say they cannot hold the account there is nothing they can do and it will be sent to collections. All of these facilities want to get paid and i want to pay them but when it comes to just waiting one more month they never want to wait. I could of paid half of that  the day we were there but they made a mistake.  The admitting person even took less of a cash payment then what i had. I had an uneven amount and she said here how about I take $50 and bill you the rest. who says that? Just seemed like she doesn't know how to do her job. I have also had out patient surgery at Renown before our insurance changed and no issues with them at all. I will most definitely not go there anymore and might have to go out of network just to get better administrative service.",

Horrible management and administrators. They put cost and time of surgery over safety. Worst place I’ve ever worked. I was subject to sexual harassment weekly, if not daily and was told it was my fault because I let it happen. I had no support from management and speed of turnaround was more important than patient safety. Never have surgery at this facility unless you’re okay with your safety being compromised.",

Now how the he'll would I know they were not their ar dept for Reno? I wouldn't so now I have to chase everything down and see if it can be fixed. Thanks a lot Summit Surgery for nothing!",

Wallet was lost right before operation, needed ID to be able to go ahead with the surgery, even though the surgery had been paid for in cash! Ended up getting a different quote on the cost of the surgery center for out-patient procedure while arguing with the ladies at the front desk that the procedure had already been paid for in full! The administrator, a very mean lady refused to let us go back. Reason being ID was needed incase an ambulance had to be called, even though you don't have to be a citizen to ride in an ambulance. I doubt they'll check to make sure you have ID. Plus I could hear them talking about the patients information sitting in the waiting room; meaning everyone could hear them (HIPPA violation). Worst experience ever! Would NEVER recommend going there! And when we tried to explain we were not going through the insurance policy, they said we had to incase something happened to the patient in 6 months and needed to meet their deductible now (total bullshit, none of their business!). Terrible place and people!!",

My husband had to schedule and pay his assistant to come in to work  so he can leave early to pick the children up from daycare.  Then....  I get a call THE EVENING BEFORE  her appointment telling me that we will need to reschedule the appointment due to them forgetting to order what they need for her fitting.\nWhen I called to see if there was anything I could do to get my daughter in and quite honestly completely confused as to why the appointment was even made for that day in the first place or at the the very least why they waited until the night before to notify me of them canceling the appointment I was met with extremely rude and unprofessional staff",

When I finally got to talk to a nurse practitioner she seemed quite perturbed by something else going on instead of being concerned about the issue at hand. I did not get a sense of an organized plan to treat what I had come in for. I was told to find more information out about my ailment from a website. Unfortunately that is why I came to them.. for better answers.  The facility is nice and seems like it could be a wonderful place for treatment. I could have come in on a bad day, however their follow through was less than infrequent and if they did they wanted to charge for talking on the phone. I hope sincerely it was just a random vague experience. I wish them well treating others.",

We went looking for treatment on a B12 deficiency and were told that their biofeedback computer is predicting that my wife has Lyme disease.  She doesn't, but the Dr wanted to begin treatment immediately and test for it later. The biofeedback test was an additional $40 and took about 5 minutes.  Counter staff was friendly and maybe it's a good practice to be treated at if your well off or have fantastic insurance, but we simply can't afford their feee schedule at $380/hr for a simple onsultc, treatment is probably even more expensive but I can't comment on that as we can't afford to go back.

They don't have a problem taking money, that is what they are good at, but they do have trouble being caring, compassionate and doing what they say they will do at their initial consultation.  They left my daugther struggle with her thyroid for over three weeks. She called and called and called and no reply. She had to reach out to other doctors in the meantime because she was suffering.\nThey wrote her a letter and dismissed her from their practice siting she was not honest about medication dosage and this couldn't be further from the truth.  The doctor would tell my daughter one thing regarding dosage, and the twenty other assistants would say something different, and since she was not allowed to talk to the doctor directly for those three plus weeks, she stuck with what the doctor told her at their last visit.\nThey also blamed her not being compliant which is a lie on their part. She is beyond compliant to treatment and only wants to get better.   She is knowledgeable about her health and stands up for what she knows is true and asks questions, and I supposed many doctors are challenged by this.\nThese people don't care about your health.\nI am a mother urging you to reconsider before going here.\n\nThey also took a double payment of $440 from her last year and still have not resolved it.  They have no good management of their office and good luck getting your calls returned, well, if you want to pay money maybe you can ask a follow up question.\n\nSo they left a very sick girl, who they had just adjusted all of her medication in a drastic way, to fend for herself.  Stay clear of these evil people who care nothing for your health.   I urge you as a mother, I haven't written anything like this ever in my life, but I don't want others to experience the same poor treatment,  I wish I could give Zero stars.\n\nThese are not caring people.

As time went on and the enourmous ammount of supplements increased my daughter began vomiting and having periods of low bp and she called them and took a day or so for a response. They continued to say it was die off and didnt take her seriously when she said she thought the supplements were doing it. She ended up taking herself off after researching the side effects, which were nausea, vomiting and could lower bp. She improved right away. No more vomiting etc. I think they are well intentioned, but find they dont listen. The apts were long, seemed like we talked about the same things and never really accomplished anything. Prices are extremely high in my opinion. Drs will not talk to you on the phone, you have to talk to nurse and Im sorry but its never good to go through a second person if you want accuracy.

I was forced to finally  buy my own MRI to find a herniated disk, pay a Radiologist to tell my Dr. then have to spend thousands more for a shot and a Dr's approval.

My sincerest thank you's you saved us!! My daughter and I we're very tired and sad all the time thinking we were never going to get over this but we did!!

         "It really saddens me to write this but I wish I would have learned this sooner.  Dr. Muth was helpful in getting me diagnosed and started me on a medication routine. I was told to come every 3 months and started going in January of 2016, so almost 3 years. Not only was an end plan never discussed but I also felt like I was paying so much money for such short visits. I dealt with it because I was scared to switch to another provider and thought this was just how I'd feel forever. I never had dramatic improvements in my symptoms just felt a little better. This past April was my last appointment. I drove 2 hours to my appointment, my husband had left work early, had saved up the $300+ dollars and was all checked in, waiting to go into the room. I went into the room where the nurse/MA took my vitals and updated my labs and says she will be in shortly. Erica was actually who ended up coming into my room, who I had never seen in my history of going to Serenity. She explained that Dr. Muth was sick and that is why she was filling in for her. Let me say that I totally understand being sick and especially in this type of field you do not want to go to work sick, but I feel I should have at least been called or told about this and given the option to continue with my appointment or reschedule. I still had to pay about the same amount, and many things I brought up I heard, \"Oh I'm not sure about that, I will have to check in with Dr. Muth about that.\" It was a completely useless appointment. I ended up writing a letter about how I was disappointed and didn't agree with this, so they had Dr. Muth call me for a phone appointment, which made me feel much better. She wanted me to get an amino acid test done before my next appointment which was the next month so I was sent the lab kit and it was to be sent out the next day. Not only did the test not get the sent the next day, but when I finally received it (2 weeks before my appointment-not enough time to do and for the Dr to get the results therefore resulting in another useless appointment) it was the WRONG test. I cancelled my appointment and decided I was done dealing with all of it. I started seeing my new LLMD in August and in my 3 appointments with him so far, he talks about an end plan for this treatment, is MUCH cheaper, spends more time with me, and they are not unorganized like Serenity. In hindsight, I now see Serenity as a place that wants to help others but doesn't have the capabilities or organizational system needed and also way overcharges. I believe I was almost used for my money now that I have had such a different experience. I hope this helps others that are struggling to get the courage and motivation to find other care!",

         "I live on the East Coast and several years ago, I had some medical issues that multiple doctors (like 5) could not diagnose properly.  One doctor said I had ADHD and depression at the same time!  Desperate, I called Dr. Muth's office (as I grew up in Wisconsin and was very familiar with Dr. Konetski) and bought a plane ticket.\n\nDr. Muth solved my issue (which was thyroid) in the matter of minutes and tested to verify.\n\nLater, my husband and I were having fertility issues - we tried for 2.5 years.  Dr. Muth reviewed my information and continually told me that \"it wasn't me.\"  She sent me lab work for my husband to get tested at a clinic.  He got tested by Shady Grove Fertility, which is a nationally recognized clinic and the results came back normal.  I called Dr. Muth back (yes, this is all over the phone, she never actually met my husband!), and told her the news.  She responded by asking me to read the numbers to her - she disagreed with their analysis and told me he needed two over the counter supplements (natural, might I add).  She said if I wasn't pregnant in 3 months to call her back.... well... it only took 2 months... AFTER 2.5 YEARS OF TRYING!!\n\nSeriously.... this woman is amazing!  She gets down to the root of the problem... and swiftly. She doesn't jump to conclusions and she uses lab work to verify everything.  AND she uses natural means first.  If you are suffering with issues or feel like no doctor really solves your problems.... this doctor is for you!",

         "I would not suggest Serenity Clinic for your healthcare needs. Working in the health care industry since 2000 as a Nurse, a PhD Researcher, and having a husband who is a physician as well, I am well aware of the standards that should occur in a medical practice. Unfortunately, Serenity is not managed or run in a manner that supports patients needs (both emotional and physical).\n\nAlthough I support integrative and functional medicine which is in itself a legitimate approach, the focus on \"non-taditional medicine\" at Serenity, such as testing and treating for parasites/viruses/bacteria detected through \"radio waves\" from a device around your neck, is not evidence-based nor is the foundation that many health and disease problems originate from Lyme's. During my visit, this was the emphasis of care and not something that makes sense with all patients.\n\nWhat was the most worrisome, was the communication and processing of results and follow-up. I had to call the clinic multiple times (>4) to obtain my labs results. On one occasion, I called for over a 2-hour period of time in the middle of the day and there was no one at the desk to answer my call. This is unusual in today's medical practice. Most clinics would average a callback to their patient's in a much shorter timed usually within 1-2 days (as examples Prohealth, Aurora and Froedtert). I left messages for MA's and front desk staff and eventually had to call the lab myself and have the results faxed to another practitioner so I could be aware of my thyroid levels that impacted my fertility treatment at another clinic. Despite communicating my concerns/frustrations with lack of follow-up, I never received my results or a follow-up call from the clinic to address my concerns or discuss a follow-up appointment.\n\nMy last concern is the misinterpretation that \"Dr.\" is portrayed for many of the practitioners at this clinic, when in fact they are not doctorate level Nurse Practitioners nor are they MD's. Although I have my PhD and would be considered a \"Dr\" I do not represent myself in that manner to prevent confusion that I can care for someone with \"medical problems\" like a physician is able. I would caution you as a patient to not put too much trust into this practice based on the poor management, communication, diagnostic techniques, and follow-up. I would suggest rather you locate an Integrative Medicine MD or Functional Medicine MD for a holistic approach combined with conventional medicinal practice.",

During this past year I have seen through their postings of special events how caring the entire staff is at Country. They have constantly gone way beyond their job description!

They were on top of it before most of us even knew what Covid was. They consistently strive to make the quality of life as good as possible while keeping the residents safe- a very tricky balancing act. Our family could not be more grateful for the kind and professional care my Mom receives daily. Friends encouraged us to consider places with newer equipment and fancy renovations and I am so glad that we chose to go with the quality of care over anything else! Relationships matter and the staff at Country are masters at co-creating healthy ones with residents and families. We can’t wait to continue our experience with them during more normal times.",

It appeared that she was receiving good care. While she was there, I did notice that they kept giving her items that included gluten, she is gluten sensitive,  so many times she got very nauseous and had diharea.\nHer doctor was excellent and called to speak with me to discuss moms progress. She was also very patient with mom. It wasn't until she went home for 2 WEEKS and fell again, followed by going back to the hospital, that we began to realize they discharged her too early. In addition,  she is now in a different rehab facility and which is helping us realize she did not recieve the treatment she needed to return home safely.  The only physical therapy she recieved while at Country was walking around her room. ( due to covid they claimed) However,  just a few weeks later at the new rehab, she recieved physical therapy exercises and felt accomplished. She said to me \" This is what I wanted to do at that other place.\"\nThe exit plan from Country entailed being called just a few days before she was expected to go home and when I stated that at previous rehabilitation centers we had a family meeting to discuss the plan I was told she called me 30 times. Well that was just not true. We did play phone tag a few times the previous week. HOWEVER, I was on vacation and was able to answer my phone ALL WEEK and the FIRST phone call I recieved that week was Thursday for a Saturday discharge. Not sure why she couldn't have called Monday- Wednesday.\nAfter reading all of the reviews about Country, I was a bit disappointed.",

The team could not possibly be more supportive and encouraging. We are always so marveled that every instructor and Shihan Kendall knows every student’s name and skill level. It really feels like a family.\n\nOur son has had times when he hasn’t attended classes as often and every time he comes back, he is welcomed with open arms and is able to dive back in quickly and always feels included.\n\nOh and their special events (movie nights, Halloween parties, and more!) are a favorite of our children. They beg to attend and come home raving about how much fun they had.\n\nDon’t think about it. Sign up. You won’t regret it.",

They immediately identify the strong personality qualities in each of the students, they make sure the kid knows it, and then they build on it. It's not all lovey-dovey either. Respect, discipline, and perseverance are big ingredients in their special sauce.\nThe net result is confidence: Not just in karate, but it bleeds into sports, into school, etc. My son is very comfortable in his own skin and I can't help but think this place has a lot to do with that.\nHighly recommended.",

I have three children that currently attend classes at the Dojo. I have a 10, 9, and 5 year old, all with very different personalities, yet they ALL love going to class every week. The instructors are very good at keeping their younger students engaged during class and always introducing new material so they never get bored. We were a little nervous once the pandemic hit and we weren't sure how the classes would be maintained now that we had to follow state guidelines. The staff did a great job at providing three different options for classes, which was wonderful . If you were more concerned with being indoors with smaller class sizes then they offered zoom classes and outdoor classes. They did an amazing job at accommodating everyone throughout  this difficult time. I am so happy we are apart of the Dojo family and we will be for years to come :)\n-The Hubbard Family",

         "Great Choice for Families\n\nI am deeply impressed with The Dojo, it's leadership, and staff  Unlike many martial art studios that are self-serving businesses 1st, and places of learning and growth 2nd, the Dojo is all about growth and learning 1st.  It is not a competitive environment, but one of supportive collaboration. People are happy to be here.  We've never felt gouged financially, and the staff are all exceptionally good with kids, of all ages. I offer this as a public school teacher of 23 years and as a martial artist of over 20 years who has seen enough dojos to compare. All dojos are not the same. Our son feels safe here, not pressured, he is eager for class, and is learning not just the physical martial art, but also underlying principles of respect, kindness, confidence, and perseverance.  Cannot recommend The Dojo strongly enough.",

         "My son has been a student at The Dojo in Salisbury for 5 years and the experience has been fantastic. The Dojo has provided a sense of community for our family and especially throughout Covid, the owners and Sensei’s seem to have made additional effort to check in with and support the students. As a parent, you get the sense that they all genuinely care. The classes (which I sometimes watch) are impressive. Sensei’s artfully meld their exceptionally high standards with supportive, enthusiastic teaching (often incorporating humor) and hand-tailoring when needed  to meet the needs and challenges of each individual student. I’ve watched our evolving martial artist gain confidence and  value effort and hard work. Highly recommend this family oriented karate school.",

         "My son has been taking karate classes for over a year now at the Dojo, and he loves it.  The instructors and staff have been incredible.  They really go out of their way for the Dojo community.  When my son needed some extra help with certain karate moves, the Dojo readily agreed to a focused one-on-one session to help him.  During COVID-19 post-reopening, I asked if the Dojo would entertain hosting a very small birthday party for my son; I knew they had hosted birthday parties pre-COVID-19.  They were more than willing to work with me to set up a safe and fun party for a small number of kids, and they all had an incredible time.  My son also participated in the summer camp program last year during COVID-19 and, even if it was the scaled-back version, he enjoyed every minute, especially the weapons training.  He is signed up for multiple sessions of Dojo camp this summer.\n\nMore recently, I asked if the Dojo had any women's self defense classes scheduled in the near future, as I wanted to learn some techniques to defend myself if I ever have a need.  They helped put together a group so that the class could happen.  The self defense class was nothing short of amazing.  The owners, Shihan Kendall and Tashi Caroline,  were both great instructors and very supportive.  Each participant went two rounds with Shihan in a Red Man protective suit.  I left the class proud and a little shocked at my ability to defend myself, and I felt a bit more confident, too.\n\nThe Dojo is fantastic in terms of the skill level of the instructors, but the experience is brought to an even higher level by the incredible, friendly, dedicated staff and instructors.  They make everyone feel comfortable, regardless of their skill level, and they are encouraging and make the experience fun.  Definitely check them out!!  They have so much to offer!",

         "I have had multiple unprofessional experiences here. The eye exam itself is always fine though. When I was picking out glasses after my most recent exam, I was not informed of any anti-glare options (whereas I did choose that option before); I guess it's my fault for not asking about this. Picked up my new glasses today and there are purple halos/reflections around any light source - makes it very hard to see clearly, especially when looking at a computer screen or driving when it's sunny. I call the office regarding the possibility of fixing this and they connect me with an optometrist; he assures me that if I come in again they will fix it. I drive across town (again), and when I get there the man at the back counter tells me actually there is nothing they can do and I am stuck with these glasses, and that I was not allowed to pay out of pocket to fix it either. Finally the issue was agreed upon to be fixed with an out of pocket payment on my 3rd visit in the same day. Your staff need to have better communication with each other - it was extremely frustrating to be told different things by different staff members. Also when ordering glasses for customers your staff need to explain the available options better, even if those options lead to out-of-pocket costs. Thank you for understanding my frustration, not to mention my wasted time and gas money.\n\nEdit - When I got my glasses back after paying $120 out of pocket for them to be fixed (I wanted the huge purple reflections removed so I could see) the glasses were returned to me in exactly the same condition, with nothing noticeable done to them. I guess I wouldn't expect anything different. Changing the review from 2 stars to 1 to reflect the quality of service I received.",

The place is 2 and 3 bed room. Separated by hanging sheets. It is as clean as you make it. Room's are jail cell size. If you care about me and whoever you send here. Send them money letters and give them you're time. The mail is not personal... They open mail with your permission. You are allowed 97$ a month after any SSI... Rsdi. Exc. I rate this place one Star if that. The owner of the company is the only admin. I have asked for a itemized bill. I'm on the council for resident s. It is almost embarrassing the way we go through motion to do anything. The building is in need of new carpet. The art work on the walls are nice. They are owned by the owner. I feel I could be more negative.... I'm 34 and live with mentally disabled people whom are being used in my humble opinion. Good luck 🙏",

It all depends on your treatment by staff.  As an employee, I was falsely accused by them and went 8 years without a regular paycheck after due to this until someone said I could sue.  Some Do No Right residents are casually slandered to all new employees--and there is huge turnover--so they are in a constant state of abuse.  You wouldn't believe me if I listed it so I won't.  And it's not my mental illness.  The inequity \"class\" system where some are driven to restaurants/stores needlessly because they come from wealthy families, and others are made to ride bus after bus with heavy loads and bruised ribs.  My resume was vandalized for the final time--I give up after they made it so staff have to open flash drives and the worker messed up my resume.  I have not eaten in the diningroom there for 4 years due to abuse/complaint/retaliation repeated over and over culminating in a horrific event.  I wrote everyone including the White House for help and haven't received any.  Champion hope?  Life is hopeless.  Guided by ethics?  The libel in the official records they write which look so professional is laughable fiction.  They've sabotaged my efforts.  I worked  there 2 years; lived there 13 1/2 years and seen so much injustice in my \"world.\"  Live here till I die?  I have no where to go, so yes.  They'll get their Do No Wrong content residents to tell you about the prime rib/shrimp/steak 7 course meals in the diningroom I can only dream of.  Life is unlivable; Christ is returning soon.  Hope this is the End Time.",

He used fear tactics to scare me into paying for Invisalign treatment without having insurance to cover it. He made it sound like there was no other option and that it was an emergency or my teeth would fall out. so I gave him 4500 dollars out of pocket. I went into a financial crisis and developed an anxiety disorder. I later gained insurance, and asked their office for help filing a pre-auth to help cover it. I spoke with Shawna there, who was incredibly rude and condescending and basically laughed at me. She refused to file a preauth and refused to help me. I later complained, and the office completely ignored my complaint. They did not regard it or apologize. probably the worst medical experience of my life. If you’re an adult needing orthodontia treatment, and looking for someone who is compassionate with good bedside manor,  I recommend *anyone* but dr McDonald and his staff. So incredibly rude and distant. They are terrible and should be ashamed of themselves. They don’t care about you, just your money.",

When signing up in October I asked about cancelation policy and was told by representative Ashley 30-day notice in person was required to cancel.  I came in to cancel in May, a few days after being charged the monthly fee, and was told I would be charged 2 more times to cancel or could pay 2 monthly fees right then.  I did rely on the verbal communication when signing up.\nThe workouts are good; the place is clean, and staff is pleasant.  Booking time slots is easy but needs to be preplanned as most convenient times get taken fast.  The company’s matts are mandatory and pricey.",

The word predatory really doesnt fit since it is written and all employees are trained to go over this as a part of signing up! Feel free to reach out if you would like another copy of your agreement that you signed. Management would've been happy to assist you had you asked. Glad you enjoyed the workouts!\"}",

I never went in and got fully set up or anything so I just didn’t think any thing of it and figured I could get started when i moved back in November. You can imagine my shock when i saw three months worth $130+ taken out of my bank account since May. I called to see what was up and was told sorry there’s nothing we can do and that they just started billing people once it opened up regardless if they had been in or not. I’m just upset that they couldn’t refund me anything seemings how I never saw the place even finished or did one work out there.",

Kasi and the staff are super awesome to work with, even the owner is very friendly and down to earth.\nI like that the gym spaces are are big enough for you and a friend or two, but its still very private which let's you really focus. On top of that, there are many benifits to working in their infared saunas; you sweat more in less time really maximizing your results, but it does make you feel fresher when you are done.\nEach workout is directed by a virtual guide which makes it very easy to follow along and very ever workout they show forms for: beginner, intermediate, and expert level participants.\nI signed up immediately and have been going 3 or 4 times a week. Their app lets you know whats available and the rest you do yourself.\nI also signed my mom and sister up and they have really loved it.",

I was needing a safe place to heal and feel. It is amazing how each man coming in gets a customized treatment plan designed just for the individual.\n\nTo have this for me and others I have seen see this carry over into their Daily lives also through a group healing therapy experience and family healing also.

         "At 64 years old, and after almost 50 years of struggling with the disease of alcohol and drug addiction, “The Ranch” was my first experience ever in any type of treatment. After 60 days of intense, and structured mental, emotional, spiritual , and physical support both “in house”, and outpatient, I experience a “me” that I didn’t realize existed. It’s never too late to heal.....no matter ones age. It’s hard work. And it will continue to be hard work for the rest of our lives. But it’s so much better than the alternatives. As addicts, or loved ones of addicts, we’re well aware of what the alternatives are. The Ranch isn’t your “boiler plate” treatment facility. It’s a safe, sacred place. They genuinely care about, and love their clients. It’s intense. But the staff insisted that we had fun, and enjoyed life. Hiking, softball, fishing, bowling, pizza parties, pool parties, and cookouts were just a few of the activities we regularly enjoyed. The “Brotherhood” that’s created amongst the clients is an experience like no other. A love that’s manifested deep inside the heart exists. We learn to love each other, and at the same time, love ourselves. We ARE our Brothers keeper. We love and support each other long after we leave the Ranch. The hard work pays  off. But one has to be ready to heal in order to reap the benefits of being sober. It’s a good life to live. Peace and serenity are not out of reach. I’ll always be grateful for, and love the Ranch, and everyone associated with the Ranch.They saved my life. God bless all of them.......especially the only friend I had left on the earth that cared enough about me to take me to them. If you’re a loved one of a struggling addict, be “that friend”.",

I look forward to our weekly recovery group meetings.  Learning about addiction and all the ways that it not only affects the addict, but also those that love the addict has been invaluable to me.

Also, they allow loved ones to go to classes that help them with their issues too. Addiction is not a one person problem, it’s a family problem. There is hope in healing families and together we can get better. Just because someone doesn’t drink or use substances doesn’t mean they don’t have issues. Everyone can benefit from this program, I am so grateful for it and my continuing  gratitude will always be to the people that are making this happen.

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

         "Don’t go to CAPS. I was left completely unsatisfied by the care I received from my CAPS psychiatrist during my senior year. I left her care in worse shape than when I first saw her. I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

I set an appointment for 10am, but apparently that means your appointment is for 9:30am for paperwork (it must be enough paperwork for a house purchase!).\n\nThe morning of, I left my house early and arrived at the campus at 9:30am. Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash.

She went back the next day with a high fever, and was told that her white blood cells were elevated,  but they didn’t know where the infection was so they gave her a general antibiotic and told her to rest. Luckily her sister was in town that night and stopped in to see her.  She took her to the emergency room because she was concerned.  Long story short, we spent the next 29 days in the hospital fighting bacterial meningitis!  And after all that, they sent us a bill for their service!  Had to pay because they will hold your grades, and you have to turn in your grades by a certain date to keep your scholarship!  1 Star is too high for this place, but you can’t leave a review without giving them that!",

He advised that I go to Pat Walker to seek help and I set an appointment.\n\nI waited about two weeks. I set an appointment for 10am, but apparently that means your appointment is for 9:30am for paperwork (it must be enough paperwork for a house purchase!).\n\nThe morning of, I left my house early and arrived at the campus at 9:30am. Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

         "This place is a complete JOKE!!!! I have been there 3 times. The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

The phlebotomist did a good job- he drew 5+ vials of blood and I barely felt it since he did a pretty good job making chit chat to distract me. My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill.

Find good mental health counselors can be hard, and CAPS is not the place for it.\n\nEdited a year and half later:\nI discovered I'm trans and there were plenty of chances for the 3 different counselors I met with to help me figure this out. Instead I went through a hell of suicidal thoughts and depression before finally figuring it out for myself. Shout out to Ryan Burchfield and Meghan Werner.

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

She went back the next day with a high fever, and was told that her white blood cells were elevated,  but they didn’t know where the infection was so they gave her a general antibiotic and told her to rest. Luckily her sister was in town that night and stopped in to see her.  She took her to the emergency room because she was concerned.  Long story short, we spent the next 29 days in the hospital fighting bacterial meningitis!  And after all that, they sent us a bill for their service!  Had to pay because they will hold your grades, and you have to turn in your grades by a certain date to keep your scholarship!  1 Star is too high for this place, but you can’t leave a review without giving them that!",

The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

The phlebotomist did a good job- he drew 5+ vials of blood and I barely felt it since he did a pretty good job making chit chat to distract me. My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill.

Instead I went through a hell of suicidal thoughts and depression before finally figuring it out for myself. Shout out to Ryan Burchfield and Meghan Werner.

We are older so when he was discharged from North Hills rehab, I really needed help.\nCornerstone is a very well run business\n,organization.\nThey communicate exceptionally well and have excellent customer service and advocacy, are flexible, and patient.\nThe people who have come to our home have been friendly, professional, knowledgeable, positive attitudes, experienced, flexible, and sensitive to my husband’s needs as well as mine.\nI’m using them for every aspect of his care, sitting with him so I can get out, and general light housekeeping.\nI highly recommend Cornerstone Caregiving.",

He came home unexpectedly early from a medical rehab facility and needed immediate support. Other agencies were unable to respond at short notice but Cornerstone had resources immediately available! What a life-saver! My uncle can be challenging to care for and requires a variety of skill sets. Susan at Cornerstone has been consistently successful in meeting his needs, and mine too, as she facilitates and supports my 'care from a distance'--we live in Alaska!

Unfortunately, the experience we had was awful.  They have brunch options on the menu and thought that would be an unusual fun menu to serve for our wedding, everybody likes breakfast food right?  Well no, they weren't able to \"accommodate\", saying their kitchen is too small for dinner time to do breakfast... whatever.  Even when I was willing to change the time of my wedding so we could get the meal we wanted they told us we wad have to chose another room with a larger food and bev minimum without discounting us... just crappy service, they can't deliver because of mediocre conditions and I have to pay the price.  There were other countless things that were crazy, $27 for a one bag of trail mix, 6$ per chair for ceremony (not too bad), however an 18% GRATUITY FEE on top of it... financial rape.  I also thought, well hey, I will do my reception somewhere else but I REALLY want to get married there, PSYCH!  They only let you do weddings if you have a reception.  How this was discussed was me emailing saying, is ceremony still the same price if I do not have a reception?  Response: you need to have a catered event in order to have a ceremony (again cryptic language not being straight forward), me: can we do our grooms dinner there? Response: No, you have to have a reception and it has to be the same day.  There's the answer I was looking for, thank you for beating around the bush yet again!  I think my favorite part of this entire experience is when the director of sales called me, ended up telling me that my concerns were valid, told me they were going to take all my ideas and apply them to their brochures (because they are not maintaining their clients expectations properly), and thanked me for helping them.  THANK YOU SO MUCH GRANDVIEW FOR LETTING ME DO YOUR JOB RIGHT AND NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HELP ME BUT TELL ME I CAN'T HAVE MY WEDDING THERE!  The wedding staff is unprofessional, they don't understand customer service, and unless you have a budget of 25k and will do your wedding exactly how they want you to do it, don't bother.  So disappointed.  Thank GOD Maddens on Gull was so accommodating and amazing, I wouldn't have been able to get married in the town I first told my fiance I loved him in otherwise.",

Which is good, but my appointment was for 9:50 and I didnt leave until close to noon. I also had to sit in the lobby with my disposable glasses while my eyes dilated because no rooms were available.\n\nOn to the good! I've been to see Dr. Smith twice now and he himself has always been great. Even when dealing with the pressure of so many appointments in one day, he did genuinely try to take his time with me and check my eyes thoroughly. Hes always been very nice and has always tried to educate me and been totally open to me calling in again if I run into any further issues. He is a great option for an eye doctor if you need one.",

While it is normal for us to sometimes have a lighthearted conversation while we work, it is never our intent for that conversation to offend anyone.  With that said, it is apparent you did not understand what was discussed during that conversation .  I, too, am from a military family.  I am the son of a retired Lt. Colonel of the United States Air Force and the grandson of two Navy veterans. I was brought up with great respect for members of our military.   The story I was recounting had to do with an under booked flight that had some open upgraded seats.  They offered them to any active duty or reservist members flying the plane.  Once it was apparent there were no members of the military on that particular flight, I politely asked if my wife and I could have those tickets as we were flying for honeymoon, as long as no one more deserving came forward to claim them.  I would NEVER lie about being in the military or suggest in any way that our service men and women shouldn't have access to any perks being offered, as there is no way we can ever truly repay what they do for our country.                  - Dr Trogdon\"}",

When they finally got around to acknowledging our existence, they were annoyed and unfriendly.  Overall, we had an equal number of good and bad encounters.",

I really appreciate your feedback because we really care about everyone that comes here and want you to have a great experience with our entire team.  I am very sorry you did not have a good experience with her.  We recently changed our policy due to COVID-19 to only allow patients into our office to minimize the number of people in our practice consistent with many other medical practices.  However, we do make exceptions in cases like yours where your wife needs help with language and other cases such as parents with minors.  You are very welcome to join her for her entire visit since she needs your assistance.  Again, thank you for your feedback and I am very sorry you did not have a good experience here. We will learn from this and strive to improve.  Brian Rodriguez - Owner UPTS'}",

Were told by the doctor its common for dogs to just stop eating and was told to force pills and special food down his throat. No blood work or xrays were done. Several days later of little to no improvement, took him back and finally forced an xray and no blockages were found. Given more pills and food. 24 hours later, no improvement so took to emergency where it was found he was in extreme kidney failure. He passed away later that same day.\nThis vet doesn't believe in modern medicine, their approach is natural supplements. Twice we were sent away with more pills than a cancer patient instead of doing a blood test. If bloodwork had been done sooner, the kidney issue would have been found and possible treatment options may have been available.\nJust know what you're getting and please ask questions if things don't sound right!
