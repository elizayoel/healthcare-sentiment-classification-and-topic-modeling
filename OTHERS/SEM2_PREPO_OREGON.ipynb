He used fear tactics to scare me into paying for Invisalign treatment without having insurance to cover it. He made it sound like there was no other option and that it was an emergency or my teeth would fall out. so I gave him 4500 dollars out of pocket. I went into a financial crisis and developed an anxiety disorder. I later gained insurance, and asked their office for help filing a pre-auth to help cover it. I spoke with Shawna there, who was incredibly rude and condescending and basically laughed at me. She refused to file a preauth and refused to help me. I later complained, and the office completely ignored my complaint. They did not regard it or apologize. probably the worst medical experience of my life. If you’re an adult needing orthodontia treatment, and looking for someone who is compassionate with good bedside manor,  I recommend *anyone* but dr McDonald and his staff. So incredibly rude and distant. They are terrible and should be ashamed of themselves. They don’t care about you, just your money.",

He used fear tactics to scare me into paying for Invisalign treatment without having insurance to cover it. He made it sound like there was no other option and that it was an emergency or my teeth would fall out. so I gave him 4500 dollars out of pocket. I went into a financial crisis and developed an anxiety disorder. I later gained insurance, and asked their office for help filing a pre-auth to help cover it. I spoke with Shawna there, who was incredibly rude and condescending and basically laughed at me. She refused to file a preauth and refused to help me. I later complained, and the office completely ignored my complaint. They did not regard it or apologize. probably the worst medical experience of my life. If you’re an adult needing orthodontia treatment, and looking for someone who is compassionate with good bedside manor,  I recommend *anyone* but dr McDonald and his staff. So incredibly rude and distant. They are terrible and should be ashamed of themselves. They don’t care about you, just your money.",

They’ve been part of our lives for over three years now with three of my children, and they have provided the best care I could possibly desire for them.  No cookie cutter plans here - Dr. McDonald develops a plan for each person based on their individual needs.  Each of my kids have some pretty unusual orthodontic needs, and Dr. McDonald has been very reassuring along the way, always avoiding extra treatment when possible.  Coming to see Dr. McDonald is never a drudgery....we’ve enjoyed getting to know each person there & almost always share a laugh.  We can’t recommend them enough!",

He used fear tactics to scare me into paying for Invisalign treatment without having insurance to cover it. He made it sound like there was no other option and that it was an emergency or my teeth would fall out. so I gave him 4500 dollars out of pocket. I went into a financial crisis and developed an anxiety disorder. I later gained insurance, and asked their office for help filing a pre-auth to help cover it. I spoke with Shawna there, who was incredibly rude and condescending and basically laughed at me. She refused to file a preauth and refused to help me. I later complained, and the office completely ignored my complaint. They did not regard it or apologize. probably the worst medical experience of my life. If you’re an adult needing orthodontia treatment, and looking for someone who is compassionate with good bedside manor,  I recommend *anyone* but dr McDonald and his staff. So incredibly rude and distant. They are terrible and should be ashamed of themselves. They don’t care about you, just your money.",

Once I went in for an appointment  and we started to talk, and Dr. McDonald asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I told him I wanted to be in the Airforce.  He ended up letting me borrow a book on planes and telling me about how he was a dentist on a navy ship.\n\nEveryone at Dr. McDonalds is so amazing and I recommend them to anyone who is looking into getting braces.\n\nTHANK YOU!!!",

He used fear tactics to scare me into paying for Invisalign treatment without having insurance to cover it. He made it sound like there was no other option and that it was an emergency or my teeth would fall out. so I gave him 4500 dollars out of pocket. I went into a financial crisis and developed an anxiety disorder. I later gained insurance, and asked their office for help filing a pre-auth to help cover it. I spoke with Shawna there, who was incredibly rude and condescending and basically laughed at me. She refused to file a preauth and refused to help me. I later complained, and the office completely ignored my complaint. They did not regard it or apologize. probably the worst medical experience of my life. If you’re an adult needing orthodontia treatment, and looking for someone who is compassionate with good bedside manor,  I recommend *anyone* but dr McDonald and his staff. So incredibly rude and distant. They are terrible and should be ashamed of themselves. They don’t care about you, just your money.",

No cookie cutter plans here - Dr. McDonald develops a plan for each person based on their individual needs.  Each of my kids have some pretty unusual orthodontic needs, and Dr. McDonald has been very reassuring along the way, always avoiding extra treatment when possible.  Coming to see Dr. McDonald is never a drudgery....we’ve enjoyed getting to know each person there & almost always share a laugh.  We can’t recommend them enough!",

He used fear tactics to scare me into paying for Invisalign treatment without having insurance to cover it. He made it sound like there was no other option and that it was an emergency or my teeth would fall out. so I gave him 4500 dollars out of pocket. I went into a financial crisis and developed an anxiety disorder. I later gained insurance, and asked their office for help filing a pre-auth to help cover it. I spoke with Shawna there, who was incredibly rude and condescending and basically laughed at me. She refused to file a preauth and refused to help me. I later complained, and the office completely ignored my complaint. They did not regard it or apologize. probably the worst medical experience of my life. If you’re an adult needing orthodontia treatment, and looking for someone who is compassionate with good bedside manor,  I recommend *anyone* but dr McDonald and his staff. So incredibly rude and distant. They are terrible and should be ashamed of themselves. They don’t care about you, just your money.",

They’ve been part of our lives for over three years now with three of my children, and they have provided the best care I could possibly desire for them.  No cookie cutter plans here - Dr. McDonald develops a plan for each person based on their individual needs.  Each of my kids have some pretty unusual orthodontic needs, and Dr. McDonald has been very reassuring along the way, always avoiding extra treatment when possible.  Coming to see Dr. McDonald is never a drudgery....we’ve enjoyed getting to know each person there & almost always share a laugh.  We can’t recommend them enough!",

He used fear tactics to scare me into paying for Invisalign treatment without having insurance to cover it. He made it sound like there was no other option and that it was an emergency or my teeth would fall out. so I gave him 4500 dollars out of pocket. I went into a financial crisis and developed an anxiety disorder. I later gained insurance, and asked their office for help filing a pre-auth to help cover it. I spoke with Shawna there, who was incredibly rude and condescending and basically laughed at me. She refused to file a preauth and refused to help me. I later complained, and the office completely ignored my complaint. They did not regard it or apologize. probably the worst medical experience of my life. If you’re an adult needing orthodontia treatment, and looking for someone who is compassionate with good bedside manor,  I recommend *anyone* but dr McDonald and his staff. So incredibly rude and distant. They are terrible and should be ashamed of themselves. They don’t care about you, just your money.",
