I was asked to make 3 follow up appointments for a simple blood pressure check and rx refill, so my guess is, that's how they make money. Holding me hostage by only giving me 30 days worth at a time, when all my other physicians saw me and refilled for a year! And they were all about ordering testing that had nothing to do with why I was there. I would not recommend this clinic.",

I called multiple times and no one could tell me how much longer or even about how long. They make you show up to register and then tell you to wait in the car. After waiting more time than I should have, Found another place in a nearby town, got right in after a short wait. After I was seen by the other doctor at the new facility I got a call from carewell. I realize times are tough right now but when I can go to another urgent care and not spend 9 hours then you know it’s the facility and not the times.",

I arrived at Dollar General about 9:30am & was the only customer there at that time. I went in & the store was clean & neat. There was 1 gentlemen there stocking shelves & a woman stocking but also watching after the register.

When I complained about the bill, the receptionist lied to my face and said they clearly informed me of the procedures and charges.
