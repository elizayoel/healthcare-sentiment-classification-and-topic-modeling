I was asked to make 3 follow up appointments for a simple blood pressure check and rx refill, so my guess is, that's how they make money. Holding me hostage by only giving me 30 days worth at a time, when all my other physicians saw me and refilled for a year! And they were all about ordering testing that had nothing to do with why I was there. I would not recommend this clinic.",

         "Reasons I would never go to Young Family Dental again:\n- Young Family Dental is sneaky in how they charge patients. They do not provide a clear summary of procedures and costs up front like other dentists, such as 9th East Dental, do. Instead, they performed unwanted procedures on me without informing me, and then later sent me a bill asking for money. When I complained about the bill, the receptionist lied to my face and said they clearly informed me of the procedures and charges. If I have the money to sue them I would.\n- They also make you sign a contract that gives them all the rights to charge you compound interest if you have unpaid overdue. I didn't have to sign something like this in the two other dentists that I went to in Provo.\n- The 5-star ratings you see are not true. Every time they get a 1-star review they cover it with fake positive reviews. You can tell all good reviews are done by the same person just by how the 5-star reviews follows a pattern and is very general and vague. In contrast, the low ratings are alot more descriptive and specific. Just use the filter \"sort by: lowest rating,\" and you'll see the consistent low rating they get in a weekly basis.",
