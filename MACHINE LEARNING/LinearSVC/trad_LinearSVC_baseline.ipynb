I was asked to make 3 follow up appointments for a simple blood pressure check and rx refill, so my guess is, that's how they make money. Holding me hostage by only giving me 30 days worth at a time, when all my other physicians saw me and refilled for a year! And they were all about ordering testing that had nothing to do with why I was there. I would not recommend this clinic.",

I arrived at Dollar General about 9:30am & was the only customer there at that time. I went in & the store was clean & neat. There was 1 gentlemen there stocking shelves & a woman stocking but also watching after the register.

When I complained about the bill, the receptionist lied to my face and said they clearly informed me of the procedures and charges.
