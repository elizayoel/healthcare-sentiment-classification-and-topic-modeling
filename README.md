# Healthcare Patient Feedback Analysis Web App

This project introduces a Streamlit-based web application designed to help healthcare institutions and facilities—including hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and diagnostic centres—monitor and analyse large-scale patient feedback. By combining sentiment classification with topic modelling, the system transforms raw reviews into actionable insights that support service improvements and strengthen patient trust.

## Dataset and Preprocessing
The project uses 1,068,688 patient text reviews. Since the reviews were unlabeled, they were annotated using SIEBERT, a transformer-based sentiment analysis model known for its robustness in transfer learning.

Reviews underwent extensive EDA and NLP preprocessing steps, including:
- Emoji handling
- Expanding contractions
- Sentence and word tokenization
- Lowercasing and punctuation removal
- Part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization
- Stopword removal

## Sentiment Classification
Both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models were developed and compared.

**ML models:**
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
- Linear SVC
- Multinomial Naïve Bayes

**DL models:**
- CNN
- LSTM
- BiLSTM
- SimpleRNN
- BiSimpleRNN
- ANN
- DNN

The best-performing model was the BiLSTM, achieving:
- Accuracy: 96.49%
- Precision: 97.86%
- Recall: 96.25%
- F1-score: 97.05%
- Lowest log loss: 0.0886

## Topic Modelling
Four topic modelling techniques were tested:
- BERTopic
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Top2Vec

The best results were obtained with BERTopic, which produced 111 coherent topic clusters. These clusters cover patient concerns such as waiting times, staff behaviour, treatment quality, and facility conditions.

## Streamlit Deployment
The application is deployed in Streamlit with an interactive multi-page layout:
1. Homepage – Overview of project and navigation
2. Sentiment Analysis – Upload reviews, view sentiment distribution and metrics
3. Topic Modelling – Explore clusters generated by BERTopic
4. Topic Exploration and Business Insights – Dashboards with sentiment trends and thematic breakdowns

## Key Contributions
- A scalable framework for healthcare feedback monitoring
- Integration of deep learning and advanced topic modelling
- Interactive dashboards for non-technical decision-makers
- Deployment-ready system using Streamlit
