I was asked to make 3 follow up appointments for a simple blood pressure check and rx refill, so my guess is, that's how they make money. Holding me hostage by only giving me 30 days worth at a time, when all my other physicians saw me and refilled for a year! And they were all about ordering testing that had nothing to do with why I was there. I would not recommend this clinic.",

Bryum is the worst healthcare product providers ever i recently ordered a dexcom start up package and its been a mess! I have had diabetes for 25 years now and never had such a hard time getting answers or even a call back! A \"sales rep\" if you will set up my order i tried to call to change my shipping address 3 times, left voicemails and even sent an email. My order was shipped any way i never received a call back still to this day & that was weeks ago... luckily it showed up i live in a very rural area and most cant find our house which was why i wanted something so expensive shipped elsewhere so it didnt come up missing. I have submitted numerous request to talk about the billing and never received a call back or email. They shipped the product to me and i received it before my insurance was ever billed what would have happened if it wasnt covered? Then they billed my insurance 4700+ dollars but originally quoted that they would bill my insurance 2270 which is what their online invoice reflects. Finally today i got a hold of someone who would actually look at it she said they bill insurance the retail price but have some kind of contracted price arranged with them? This would have been nice to know at the beginning because my cost (20%) of that 4700 vs the 2270 is not something i am prepared for on top of having to buy a new pump this month since animas sold out. Over all the most frustrating part of all of this is the lack of customer service a simple call back would have even been nice saying hey we have received your request we are working on that now and will be in touch or a call back from my \"personal sales rep\"",

They do not provide a clear summary of procedures and costs up front like other dentists, such as 9th East Dental, do. Instead, they performed unwanted procedures on me without informing me, and then later sent me a bill asking for money. When I complained about the bill, the receptionist lied to my face and said they clearly informed me of the procedures and charges. If I have the money to sue them I would.\n- They also make you sign a contract that gives them all the rights to charge you compound interest if you have unpaid overdue. I didn't have to sign something like this in the two other dentists that I went to in Provo.\n- The 5-star ratings you see are not true. Every time they get a 1-star review they cover it with fake positive reviews. You can tell all good reviews are done by the same person just by how the 5-star reviews follows a pattern and is very general and vague. In contrast, the low ratings are alot more descriptive and specific. Just use the filter \"sort by: lowest rating,\" and you'll see the consistent low rating they get in a weekly basis.",
