When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

There is not a lot of communication if you need it and they changed my prescription to a different brand without telling me after about 4-5 months. Also if this was a review of just their customer service I would give one star. Now it's my birthday and I am on my period because I can't get my prescription any longer.

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

         "This review is of Dr. Chad Lundstrom.  It is not related Dr. Sato, massage therapists, or office personnel at Lundstrom Chiropractic. I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.

I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.

It is not worth your time or the hassle you will probably be dealing with months later.\nI brought my daughter in for her first check up. I paid at the time of service in full, out of pocket-no insurance. 3.5 months later I get a bill saying I owe more money. I called and it took a lot of back and forth phone tag for someone to finally figure out what I was being charged for. I was being charged for THEIR MISTAKE!!! They said, oops we charged you as a return patient instead of a new patient so you owe us the difference that these visits cost.\nThey should have had better customer service and just eaten the cost. It wasn’t even that much. But it’s a matter of principle. Looks like they make these kinds of mistakes very frequently, charging others hundreds of extra dollars and expecting their patients to pay for the billing department’s mistakes. Oh, and then when you try and get it resolved, they will lie to you saying that the person in charge will call you but they won’t. They will write a cowardly email instead saying that you still owe them money and if you don’t pay it then interest will also be tacked on.\nIf you want to avoid dealing with liars and thieves, stay away from this office.\nThey will also write a robot response to this review saying they want to make things better and to contact them. They won’t many anything better. I already tried contacting the COO. They just want their dirty money. They lost all of my future business.",

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment.

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!!

The administrator, a very mean lady refused to let us go back. Reason being ID was needed incase an ambulance had to be called, even though you don't have to be a citizen to ride in an ambulance. I doubt they'll check to make sure you have ID. Plus I could hear them talking about the patients information sitting in the waiting room; meaning everyone could hear them (HIPPA violation). Worst experience ever! Would NEVER recommend going there! And when we tried to explain we were not going through the insurance policy, they said we had to incase something happened to the patient in 6 months and needed to meet their deductible now (total bullshit, none of their business!).

My husband is new to insulin injections and so there is medical equipment covered by Medicare Part B but not Medicare Part A.\nI am sure the pharmacists are qualified and competent. That is not a concern at all. The ladies that operate the transactions don't appear to understand the questions, concerns OR be knowledgeable about Medicare Part A versus Part  B. After arguing with me about my husband's diabetic supplies that were covered by Medicare Part B and telling me they were NOT covered, it was suggested I should just purchase the test strips and pay out of pocket for them myself. I explained I would NOT be doing that. The clerk was finally able to click the correct computer buttons to discover that, INDEED, I did not need to pay $275 for test strips but just $5.99 Co Pay. The other issue is making phone calls to the Safeway Pharmacy in Stayton. It is impossible to actually speak to a staff member after hitting the prompt #4. After 25 calls and never being able to speak to anyone, I had to drive to the safeway store and stand in line at the pharmacy to ask if my husband's prescriptions  were ready and if they received them from the doctor. I was told they received the prescriptions but would not be ready for 2 hours. Not answering the phone is very unprofessional. It's very inconvenient to have to drive to the safeway store and go to the pharmacy in order to be able to ask a simple question after waiting in  line to do so.

It is our policy to ask this question to all prospective patients, in order to eliminate any confusion. You told us that you have Medicaid dental coverage. My staff explained to you that we do not participate with Medicaid, and that your out-of-pocket expense for an exam and x-ray would be $310. We asked you if you would still like to schedule an appointment, and you said yes.”\nThis statement is untrue. Were you there at the time at of the initial phone call? Apparently, your staff dropped the ball and is now back pedaling to cover herself.  I wasn’t informed until after the examination.\nI have audio of both phone calls and you all were rude. I do not feel comfortable stepping foot in your hostile environment.  It is insult of my character to even think that I would step foot in office that did not accept my insurance and then dispute the charges. That does not make sense.\nFrom reading the previous responses this happened to someone else as well. I do not know these people however, the same price of 180$ and similar situation is written below. This will be my last response and just bill the 90$. Hopefully, I can caution other people from this experience.\n\nRE: FROM D YOUNG\nMy husband was sent to Dr. Jackson for something suspicious on his gums to rule out cancer. They asked for his medical insurance and after the exam and x-rays, he was advised to pay over $180 for the entire visit. When I called to ask them to file under his insurance, they did and then informed is nothing was covered under the plan. The office staff stated he would have had to go to a different oral surgeon from a hospital for his medical insurance to come into play. He was never informed he would be responsible even though they told me they did. They lied and they should have referred us somewhere else where our insurance would have covered this. Poor customer service. Will never go back.\n\nUPDATE: After reading Dr. Jackson’s response, it’s such a shame that he is lying about telling my husband. After having to pay after everything, my husband came home and told me if they had told me, I would have LEFT! He would have found the proper doctor.

Two months after the MRI I received a $230 invoice.   Called the number on the invoice over 10 times on hold every time over 45 minutes.  Finally went in and spoke to some, had to wait 30 min, informed the insurance was \"an estimate\" only.  When I explained I had asked for both cash and insurance to make a decision. He was very polite and said it could not be changed since it had already been billed to insurance.

Go to CVS or your primary care doctor. It's a total JOKE that they promised to return the deposit if you insurance covered 100%.\nCame here with my husband a few weeks ago for the the i693. We called in advance to insurance to make sure all the vaccines listed in their website are covered 100% under preventative care.\nOn the day of examination, we were told we need Tdap vaccines, they charged $105 as deposit ($75 for vaccine itself and $30 administration fee), and told us if our insurance covered 100%, deposit will be returned to us. HOWEVER, on the processed claim we received from insurance, it cleared indicated that the tdap is covered 100%, the allowed amount for tdap is $58, and insurance paid $58,100%. BFAC told us they would only return us $58 as this is what paid to them.\nCOME ON, I know claims quite well, I know what allowed amount and paid amount means. The $58 allowed amount is the negotiated rate that Dr. Leung agreed with insurance company to get paid by them for the service you would render to members covered by that insurance.\nSo in our case, it is indeed covered 100%, how can you have a contractural rate with insurance company and gain the benefit of accessing to their member pool while still try to make additional money from the patients???  IF you told us earlier that we have to make sure the allowed amount to be $105 by insurance company, we will go to CVS instead.\nI called the office this Monday and they said they would get back to me on this which they never did.... very disappointed about the way they conduct business here.",

We are glad we were able to resolve your issue.\\nAs a result, to streamline our process, we have decided NOT to require a deposit for vaccines going forward. Instead, we ask that all applicants please check with your insurance for coverage prior to your appointment (for details, go to www.i693.org for vaccine requirements). Please be aware that the applicant is ultimately responsible for the cost of the vaccines if insurance denies the reimbursement for any reason. Applicants continue to have the option of obtaining vaccines at their PCP or local pharmacy (we will give you scripts for the required vaccines during the interview).\\nWe hope that this new policy helps to improve your experience and reduce the stress of the immigration process.'}",

We are required to follow specific billing guidelines and I ensure you that is what we do. Since you had two procedures performed we are required to bill each code x2. We cannot guarantee what you as the patient will be left with as every insurance and every plan that they provide are different. We do not know the specifics of your plan or if you have met your deductibles. Some payers will not provide us with that information even if we call them and ask. There are too many factors that play into each patients insurance plan and therefore it is the patients responsibility to communicate with their insurance directly to confirm what will be covered and what will not be. If you are in need of a payment plan to assist with the amount that your insurance left to you feel free to contact our billing department at 844-714-8688 and they will be able to assist you.'}",

Billing office is saying Next Gen has it, lol they’ve transferred my money between three different accounts under the company I swear, glad I’m helping their stocks 😂 such a joke company- steward healthcare, and Rocky Mountain is a complete joke of health care. Stay away, they want you to prepay for innacurate estimates, then keep your credits in their bank accounts because apparently corporate has the money and doesn’t coordinate with the office ever... great... would’ve been nice to know before paying them.  I guess corporate doesn’t follow up with them ever and they’ve been waiting a month to hear back.... shocked to see people still work for this company. *** update... here we are 7 months later and still no refund. Manager won’t even call me back. Shadiest place I’ve ever been too. I have bills, a new baby, and medical costs that I should be able to spend MY MONEY on. How messed up can people be. Keeping money that is not there’s, so unethical. *****\nI wish there was 0 stars. The coordination between the office and the outside billing offices done by this clinic is completely irresponsible and incorrect ( to be clear, the clinic is completely responsible).  I was told very firmly at my first visit for prenatal care by the “insurance person” (rather not point out names because I blame the management) that If I didn’t pay my co-payment they were estimating before I gave birth that Stacie (my midwife, she has left to a better practice thank goodness) would not deliver my baby. 1. It was my first visit, 2. I have never paid a late bill in my life. 3. I never said I wasn’t able to pay it.... I used to work for a doctor and managed his office and would never talk to a patient that way. It’s as simple as stating, “we have talked to your insurance provider, they are estimating to save you $$ this amount, your portion will be this amount $$, Our office requires the co payment prior to your delivery, does that sound correct to you?” It’s not rocket science to be polite. Anyways- main issue. They gave me an option to pay monthly up to my estimate amount so I would t have to pay such a large amount when I gave birth. I agreed, thought it would help me budget and I wouldn’t have to worry about the bill when it came around. Signed a contract and all with their insurance coordinater. Well I gave birth Mar 1 18 and I get a bill for $299, 1. I prepaid a lot more than that!( annoying but not their fault I understand I am responsible for my insurance, 2. I prepaid? So I call, absolutely no one could help me and just gave me an 800 #. The billing # told me that this clinic has switched billing offices and my money probably went to the old one. I’m in complete awe. You are going to take someone’s money well in advanced for your office’s services, and not think to transfer the money your patient has prepaid to the new billing office? Total incompetence. It’s now June, and my money has not been transferred to the correct billing office, 16 calls later they have my account on hold because they were sending me collection letters. (When I’ve overpaid in advance!!) the outside billing offices have been the most helpful, the office itself is completely idiotic. The outside current billing office is still waiting for coordination with Rocky Mt. Women’s healthcare. If I do go to collections, I will be taking legal action and have a reference to anyone else being affected by this. Save yourself the trouble, go somewhere else. I’m glad Stacie left, this place is a nightmare. Way to make my first months as a mother the most stressful possible when they should be helping the most.\n- stressed out new mother.",

Manager won’t even call me back. Shadiest place I’ve ever been too. I have bills, a new baby, and medical costs that I should be able to spend MY MONEY on. How messed up can people be. Keeping money that is not there’s, so unethical. *****\nI wish there was 0 stars. The coordination between the office and the outside billing offices done by this clinic is completely irresponsible and incorrect ( to be clear, the clinic is completely responsible).  I was told very firmly at my first visit for prenatal care by the “insurance person” (rather not point out names because I blame the management) that If I didn’t pay my co-payment they were estimating before I gave birth that Stacie (my midwife, she has left to a better practice thank goodness) would not deliver my baby. 1. It was my first visit, 2. I have never paid a late bill in my life. 3. I never said I wasn’t able to pay it.... I used to work for a doctor and managed his office and would never talk to a patient that way. It’s as simple as stating, “we have talked to your insurance provider, they are estimating to save you $$ this amount, your portion will be this amount $$, Our office requires the co payment prior to your delivery, does that sound correct to you?” It’s not rocket science to be polite. Anyways- main issue. They gave me an option to pay monthly up to my estimate amount so I would t have to pay such a large amount when I gave birth. I agreed, thought it would help me budget and I wouldn’t have to worry about the bill when it came around. Signed a contract and all with their insurance coordinater. Well I gave birth Mar 1 18 and I get a bill for $299, 1. I prepaid a lot more than that!( annoying but not their fault I understand I am responsible for my insurance, 2. I prepaid? So I call, absolutely no one could help me and just gave me an 800 #. The billing # told me that this clinic has switched billing offices and my money probably went to the old one. I’m in complete awe. You are going to take someone’s money well in advanced for your office’s services, and not think to transfer the money your patient has prepaid to the new billing office? Total incompetence. It’s now June, and my money has not been transferred to the correct billing office, 16 calls later they have my account on hold because they were sending me collection letters. (When I’ve overpaid in advance!!) the outside billing offices have been the most helpful, the office itself is completely idiotic. The outside current billing office is still waiting for coordination with Rocky Mt. Women’s healthcare. If I do go to collections, I will be taking legal action and have a reference to anyone else being affected by this. Save yourself the trouble, go somewhere else. I’m glad Stacie left, this place is a nightmare. Way to make my first months as a mother the most stressful possible when they should be helping the most.\n- stressed out new mother.",

They have a nice waiting room for the kids, and the whole process was well thought out and a good experience for the kids. We had to have a tooth removed for a cavity and some other work done. It ended up being a few thousand dollars with very little help from our insurance. The whole process went very well, we paid them and we thought it was done.\n\nHowever, several months later we go to schedule a cleaning, and they tell us we aren't welcome there anymore. I was shocked and ask why. They say that we didn't pay the $30 copay for the insurance. (Which we paid as soon as we received the notice). They sent us to collections over it and blacklisted us. Maybe they sent us a notice in the mail and it got lost or we misplaced it, I have no idea. But we just payed you thousands of dollars and started taking our 2 young children there for what would have been years of checkups and procedures performed. It doesn't seem worth it to lose all of that for a $30 copay that we didn't even know existed until we were sent to collections over it. Not to mention having zero empathy or understanding for the customer and causing this sort of negative review and criticism. I understand that you did everything within your procedures and that technically we were wrong because we accidentally missed this small copay, however this is no way to treat people. I hope in the future you can treat people with a little more respect, understanding, and courtesy. I'd hate for another family to have to go through this sort of unkind behavior and negative experience.",

The last thing we want for any of our patients is to have a less than great experience, and we always try our very best to go above and beyond to assure that each patient has the best PT experience possible.\\n\\nAfter reviewing your comment in regard to your bill due to your Deductible not your copay we feel it necessary to go over in detail what your deductible is and how it works.  A great deal of this information is written out specifically in the financial agreement that you signed in your intake paperwork.  Your deductible is how much you have to spend for covered health services before your insurance company pays anything.  This is an agreement that you have with your health insurance company.  (Similar to a deductible with auto insurance).\\n\\nIn some instances we are able to find out if you do in fact have a deductible but, many times there is no way for us to know what your deductible is or how much has  already been met.  When it comes to payments such as your co payment we are able to inform you of the amount in that you would need to pay as we would have to collect this payment each visit.  There are many health insurance payment plans for different services like checkups and or management programs, before you've met your deductible but in order to know the specifics, you, as the insured we would advise you to check your plan details as not every plan is the same.\\n\\nWe understand your feelings about receiving a high bill in the mail.  However, the bill that you received was directed to be sent to you from the billing company as there was only a certain percentage that your insurance company was set to pay due to your individual health plan.\\n\\nGenerally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher deductibles & plans with higher monthly premiums usually have lower deductibles.  Again, we want to address this challenge as the last thing we want is for any patient to have a less than great experience.  We hope this information was at the very least informative and we hope it benefits you in the future in the event that you require treatment again as it will not matter where you receive your treatment as you would still receive the same bill.  Please call us to discuss your balance because we would be happy to work it out with you.\\n\\nRespectfully,\\nThe Broadway-PT Team\"}",

God bless my doctor because he came back to the hospital that night to order me a PCA pump due to the nurses not being able to stay on my medication schedule which caused me more pain.  It took the nurses 2 hours to even get the machine to work.  It was new and they didn't know how to work was what they said.  It was three of them trying to fix the pump.  I called and talk the nursing director who seemed concerned but I still had poor care from the nurses until I left to go home.  This was not my first surgery so I know how you should be treated with good care.  I sure hope the the hospital read these reviews and do things that will help amd benefit the future patients!!!

Although this may seem like a long time, you can wait in your car prior to having the test done, and can go home and wait to be video-called with the results. It is much quicker than the 6-10 days it takes for the CVS COVID-19 nasal swab to result. Definitely worth the wait initially to get results communicated quickly!",

I was given a prescription that the medication that was prescribed me didn't help me at all.    I called the emergency back and everytime I called,  they wouldn't want to transfer me to the assigned doctor for that day and I had asked and called the doctor who treated me that day I went to emergency, called and left a message but never got a call back so I end up seeing my primary doctor since I was sick from flu for a total of 8 days.    I felt soo much better after seeing my primary doctor since she prescribed me some antibiotic and it worked for me compare to the medication that was given to me from the emergency.   I would never go back to this hospital ever again.    This hospital doesn't know how to follow up with the patient to see if how's the condition after leaving from the emergency.

We did verify with our infection control nurse that cleaning the hub, as you noted, with alcohol is the proper protocol. Lastly, you\\'re not the first to mention the specks of blood, but these are not specks of blood and are actually pieces of the foam packaging the containers come from. We\\'ve let the manufacturer know to stop using pink peanuts for packing. Lastly, the secretary you mentioned is actually our Chief Medical Assistant who was filling in at the front desk that day. Rest assured she is overqualified and currently in medical school. We don\\'t use \"secretaries\" it\\'s an antiquated and somewhat demeaning term to our dedicated team members.

         "In order, here is a list of my medical \"treatment\" from Kaiser Permanente.\n\n1. Having troubles sleeping. Would get 3-4 hours per night. Doctor prescribed me Flexaril, a muscle relaxer, in the hopes that it would help me relax for bed. Didn't work.\n\n2. Had one long headache that began at the neck, and radiated to the right side of my head. At it's worst, it was debilitating. Doctor gave me Flexaril again, hoping that it was a muscular issue. It wasn't. The next appointment I made, he said he was out of ideas, and that I should try acupuncture, but it's not covered by insurance. Tried it. Didn't work.\n\n3. Had the heel of my foot run over by a forklift at my work. I wish I could say I was kidding when my doctor prescribed me, you guessed it, Flexaril, hoping it would have a painkiller attribute.\n\n4. Switched doctors after the previous incident, as I have a lifetime supply of Flexaril. Managed to throw out my back at work. I was extremely scared, almost wanting an ambulance. Decided to do Kaiser Urgent Care. Called ahead. They refused service to me because it happened on the job. They REFUSED service, even though I wasn't going to make this into an OJI claim.\n\n5. Here's where it goes downhill. One year after the initial headache set in, still going strong. Decided to make a new appointment with a my new doctor. He determined that it was probably blood pressure related (as mine was around 170/100), and gave me Atenelol. Did not solve the problem, did not lower my blood pressure.\n\n6. Make another appointment, as the Atenelol makes me feel a little light headed. Switches me to Lisinopril. Blood pressure still not going down (high BP comes from immense stress at job). Light headedness worsens. Make another appointment.\n\n7. Wore a blood pressure cuff for 24-hours at doctor's behest. Results came back inconclusive, but I had to CALL AND ASK FOR MY RESULTS. After waiting for over a week, I decided to call, and the staff said \"oh, yeah, your results are in. Nobody called you? Huh.\" Head getting lighter, numbness in extremities, everything getting worse.\n\n8. One evening, while watching TV with my girlfriend, my heart rate exploded, and I passed out. 911 was called, and the paramedics told me my heart rate was around 180bpm, and my blood pressure was around 200/100. So, obviously, I called to make an appointment with Kaiser, to which the receptionist said that they wouldn't be able to get me in for another couple of weeks. All symptoms worsening.\n\n9. Finally get an appointment. So dizzy and lightheaded all day, I can barely talk or function. Doctor decides I should wear a portable heart monitor for 24hrs (like an EKG). After that was done, I waited for TWO WEEKS to get my results, and then had to call in again, despite having a scheduled doctor's call to discuss my results. They refused to give me the results, saying that it was sent in an email on the KP website. Logged in, found the message stating that the results were inconclusive, and that \"if you want to, you can make another appointment.\"\n\nI have always been a healthy person, with stellar check-ups from my previous healthcare provider. Right now, I'm too dizzy, light headed, and numb to even drive. Kaiser has done nothing to help me. I can't switch providers right now, and I'm literally scared for my life. I don't know what to do.\n\nThis is a cautionary tale. DO NOT use Kaiser insurance.\n\nSide-note: Lisinopril is a pretty gnarly drug. After taking it for a while, it made me sickly and weak, and did nothing for my BP. Use medicine like this as a last resort. I weaned myself off of it over the course of a month, and started drinking herbal teas, and eating better. My BP is around 130/80 now. Don't just cram prescriptions down your throat as a first resort, especially when you know that someone, somewhere, it making money by treating you rather than curing you.",

Finally get an appointment. So dizzy and lightheaded all day, I can barely talk or function. Doctor decides I should wear a portable heart monitor for 24hrs (like an EKG). After that was done, I waited for TWO WEEKS to get my results, and then had to call in again, despite having a scheduled doctor's call to discuss my results. They refused to give me the results, saying that it was sent in an email on the KP website. Logged in, found the message stating that the results were inconclusive, and that \"if you want to, you can make another appointment.\"\n\nI have always been a healthy person, with stellar check-ups from my previous healthcare provider. Right now, I'm too dizzy, light headed, and numb to even drive. Kaiser has done nothing to help me. I can't switch providers right now, and I'm literally scared for my life. I don't know what to do.\n\nThis is a cautionary tale. DO NOT use Kaiser insurance.\n\nSide-note: Lisinopril is a pretty gnarly drug. After taking it for a while, it made me sickly and weak, and did nothing for my BP. Use medicine like this as a last resort. I weaned myself off of it over the course of a month, and started drinking herbal teas, and eating better. My BP is around 130/80 now. Don't just cram prescriptions down your throat as a first resort, especially when you know that someone, somewhere, it making money by treating you rather than curing you.",

We go in the room and He has me pull up my shirt around the waist band and \"Spin around for him \"(which has never happened to me before but i still cooperated )  Went into  the bathroom to give my sample. When I came out of the bathroom i washed my hands and he 'Smelled' my urine right in front of me making a 'whiffing' noise. He told me that my urine doesn't smell like pee. Then he told me to smell it myself. I refused to put a cup with urine in it to my nose. He then shut the door and locked it and told me to prove I didn't have anything on me by lifting up my shirt. I refused. and he told me he was only \"trying to help me\" He told me if I didn't that it would be an automatic fail due to it \"not smelling like urine\"\n\nThis man was unprofessional and harassing me. He was so inappropriate on many levels. I left the office crying. I refuse to let this man get away with his behavior as i am sure he has done this to other patients.",

The deli workers in the evening never have out fresh food, and it's obvious they hate dealing with customers. Same thing with the meat and produce department. The bakery as far as I know has been consistent. The only good aspects about this grocery store are the fact that its clean and is cheaper than its competitor Publix.
