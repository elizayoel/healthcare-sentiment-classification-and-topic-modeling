Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

         "This review is of Dr. Chad Lundstrom.  It is not related Dr. Sato, massage therapists, or office personnel at Lundstrom Chiropractic. I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you do not, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

         "Wow. The billing department is dishonest. Listen to me and others when we warn you to NOT COME HERE. It is not worth your time or the hassle you will probably be dealing with months later.\nI brought my daughter in for her first check up. I paid at the time of service in full, out of pocket-no insurance. 3.5 months later I get a bill saying I owe more money. I called and it took a lot of back and forth phone tag for someone to finally figure out what I was being charged for. I was being charged for THEIR MISTAKE!!! They said, oops we charged you as a return patient instead of a new patient so you owe us the difference that these visits cost.\nThey should have had better customer service and just eaten the cost. It wasn’t even that much. But it’s a matter of principle. Looks like they make these kinds of mistakes very frequently, charging others hundreds of extra dollars and expecting their patients to pay for the billing department’s mistakes. Oh, and then when you try and get it resolved, they will lie to you saying that the person in charge will call you but they won’t. They will write a cowardly email instead saying that you still owe them money and if you don’t pay it then interest will also be tacked on.\nIf you want to avoid dealing with liars and thieves, stay away from this office.\nThey will also write a robot response to this review saying they want to make things better and to contact them. They won’t many anything better. I already tried contacting the COO. They just want their dirty money. They lost all of my future business.",

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.

Nothing ever gets resolved, instead they see you for 5 mins and say see you in two weeks.

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

         "Wow. The billing department is dishonest. Listen to me and others when we warn you to NOT COME HERE. It is not worth your time or the hassle you will probably be dealing with months later.\nI brought my daughter in for her first check up. I paid at the time of service in full, out of pocket-no insurance. 3.5 months later I get a bill saying I owe more money. I called and it took a lot of back and forth phone tag for someone to finally figure out what I was being charged for. I was being charged for THEIR MISTAKE!!! They said, oops we charged you as a return patient instead of a new patient so you owe us the difference that these visits cost.\nThey should have had better customer service and just eaten the cost. It was not even that much. But it is a matter of principle. Looks like they make these kinds of mistakes very frequently, charging others hundreds of extra dollars and expecting their patients to pay for the billing department’s mistakes. Oh, and then when you try and get it resolved, they will lie to you saying that the person in charge will call you but they will not. They will write a cowardly email instead saying that you still owe them money and if you do not pay it then interest will also be tacked on.\nIf you want to avoid dealing with liars and thieves, stay away from this office.\nThey will also write a robot response to this review saying they want to make things better and to contact them. They will not many anything better. I already tried contacting the COO. They just want their dirty money. They lost all of my future business.",

Our staff is available via text and phone Monday-Friday 9am-5pm PST. We only send out what is written on your prescription. If your prescription indicates that an equivalent is allowed and we must send you an equivalent, it is protocol for our pharmacists to send you a text alerting you that we will be sending you an equivalent. We take the safety of our patients very seriously and if our medical team is unable to provide you with a prescription, we will let you know and refer you out to a medical provider who could provide you with the necessary in-person assessment and follow up needed. We are always happy to transfer your prescription to our pharmacy once you are able to obtain it with the in-person evaluation needed. If you need further assistance or clarification, please give us a call at 772-217-4557 during our business hours M-F 9am-5pm and our pharmacy team would be happy to help you! Thank you.\"}",

There is not a lot of communication if you need it and they changed my prescription to a different brand without telling me after about 4-5 months. Also if this was a review of just their customer service I would give one star. Now it is my birthday and I am on my period because I cannot get my prescription any longer. Worst customer support/service ever. Hopefully, I will be able to find a new company that can find a nice balance between customer service and production.",

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",
