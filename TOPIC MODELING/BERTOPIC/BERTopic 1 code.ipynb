Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.

I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that ‚Äúfurther communication with me would not be useful.‚Äù  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

         "This review is of Dr. Chad Lundstrom.  It is not related Dr. Sato, massage therapists, or office personnel at Lundstrom Chiropractic. I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you do not, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that ‚Äúfurther communication with me would not be useful.‚Äù  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

They will write a cowardly email instead saying that you still owe them money and if you don‚Äôt pay it then interest will also be tacked on.\nIf you want to avoid dealing with liars and thieves, stay away from this office.\nThey will also write a robot response to this review saying they want to make things better and to contact them.

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

was treated poorly by everyone i interacted with there i went there years ago for a routine cleaning the dentist did fillings after telling me i only needed never told me did not know till i got my bill he drilled down into the pulp on one tooth and did not tell me cracked another tooth and did not tell me i had to have a root canal on the one he drilled into the pulp on after months of terrible pain the cracked tooth hurt for a year and a half before i got a root canal on that one today i had to get the cracked tooth yanked and an implant put in because it was cracked all the way to the root and it is terrible i get that the drilling into the pulp and cracking the other tooth maybe could have happened with any dentist but he never said a word about it i contacted the young family dental office after i found out from another dentist that he had drilled into my pulp and cracked the other tooth to ask them what the heck and why i was never told about any of it and they never even emailed me back and the person on the phone was very flippant and unapologetic what is worse is i had them send my xrays to another dentist who told me of the fillings the young family dental dentist did were not even necessary terrible do not go there it is been years and i am still suffering from my visit there', 'please do not ever get dental work done here especially by dr samad my mother and i had been clients of this practice since i was a toddler we saw dr abecket about four years ago i came in for a regular checkup i had never needed any sort of dental work before in my life no fillings etc and i got cleanings and checkups regularly when i saw dr samad i suddenly needed a root canal i had no pain or other symptoms typically i would have gone for a second opinion however in this case i was about to go abroad for six months dr samad pressured my mother and i into my getting a root canal that day direct quote you do not want her needing dental work overseas i have seen some of the work that gets done over there and you do not want that the root canal was painful and my face was swollen for two weeks afterwards looking back i am sure that i did not need a root canal and they just wanted our money four years later the crown that i got on that day broke off suddenly while i was at work i go to my new dentist they take an xray of the tooth and recommend that i go to see a root canal specialist for a second opinion both my dentist and the root canal specialist have told me that the root canal was not done correctly and there is an infection beneath the post that dr samad put in my tooth thanks to dr samad i am now needing a tooth extraction and implant thousands of dollars of dental work at the age of there are tons of great dentists in this area please do not waste your time and money at this practice', 'my new patient appointment did not go well my main purpose for coming to aspen was to get a second opinion on my wisdom teeth and pricing details for an insurance i was looking into getting for wisdom teeth and other services all of which i told the operator on the phone when i called so my appointment was for first available of the day i got there at filled out my paperwork and waitedand waitedand waited some more it was well after before i was called back and learned they were still waiting for the dentist to get there i got my xrays and was taken to a room where i waitedand waited and waited some more finally the dentist came in i explain to him that my primary concern were my wisdom teeth he took a quick look at the xrays and said if they are concerning me might as well get them out he then spent less than a minute blowing air on my teeth and concludes that i had cavities i felt he was more concerned about being behind schedule than he was about putting any thought or effort into my exam that or all new patient evaluations are quick and impersonal i felt no connection as i was asking about my wisdom teeth and do not appreciate his quick exam of my teeth and being told i have cavities it felt like a way to get more business and money afterward i had the chance to speak with the office manager to discuss any questions or concerns right away she wanted to schedule a time to fill those cavities i said i was mainly concerned about my wisdom teeth and wanted pricing for the two plans the insurance offered that i was looking into getting but was told since i did not have the insurance she could not give prices i found it very lacking that the very thing i was there for could not be done again this is something i explicitly told the operator when i called and secondly is not it part of the job to be able to give pricing here i was a potential new customer and i was left with no incentive to use aspen dental she made no attempt for find a way to get me a ball park cost but did inform me that the oral surgeon was not in the network for the insurance i was looking into when i asked about a cash discount i was told to go to the website for coupons overall my visit did not go well although the office staff was extremely friendly and they offer the new patient exam for free i felt i wasted my time an appointment that should have took minutes at most ended up lasting until am update i went to my regular dentist and he found no cavities']"

after a bit this pa named brian came for my checkup he appeared to not have any social manners and in fact acted quite indifferent also note that there was no any other additional procedures carried out beside me answering question about my medical history and him feeling my shoulder for few seconds after a month of my visit i got a bill from them for over they had billed my insurance first since my insurance denied based on my deductible i got the bill to pay this incredible sum for a simple office visit i checked doctor expresss website to see how much it cost for such visit it shows for selfpay i called their billing department to sort my bill out and asked for why i was being charged such a ridiculous amount when the website clearly shows for the office visit i was explained that it was because i have an insurance and i gave them my insurance information so clearly they increase the price to charge the insurance and if insurance does not pay the outrageous charge it is on patient to pay it now if i had chosen to not give them insurance information and just paid right away it would have been only please note that the people at doctors express did not explain any of this to me they simply asked if i had insurance i said yes and gave my card my insurance did not pay due to my deductible and i was stuck paying fee higher than the selfpay they did reduce it after a long struggle of getting hold of the billing department and discussion it appears quite slimy to advertise for the office visit and charge higher amount to the people who have insurance i was clearly punished for having an insurance lastly my husband had visited zoom care when he was ill he paid exactly what is advertised on their website despite him having an insurance and him giving them his insurance information if i could give negative star to doctors express i would so people out there if you are thinking of going to doctors express for your urgent care choose zoom care instead', 'read to avoid billing nightmare i started having appointments here in february i was told i would have minute appointments virtually so the first thing is that i never had any appointment last minutes appointments total minutes tops per appointment very basic information being asked and very basic advice given dealing with anxiety i never felt comfortable to ask why my appointment was not lasting minutes i figured i would just be billed for the time i did get with my dr but unfortunately i was billed each time for minutes and that is the next thing that was an absolute nightmare the billing process or their billing company that they used is awful when i first called anywhere clinic i asked if they took anthem blue cross which is what my card said it turns out that on the back of my card it says my actual mental health insurance through blue cross is mhn so anywhere clinic tried to bill anthem and anthem told them that they needed to reach out to mhn with my billing information i never heard anything back from them after that one call about my insurance needing to be sent to mhn i eventually got this huge bill in the mail stating that my insurance did not cover anything long story short i had to call my insurance to see what i needed to do about this since their billing department never answered any calls or ever called me back after leaving more than voicemails throughout weeks by the way i had all appointments before they told me this issue with my insurance i stopped the appointments immediately so i called my insurance mhn and explained everything and she explained to me that i did not do anything wrong and it is their responsibility to get your insurance card to see who to bill before you even have one appointment since it was virtual she said they should have asked me for a picture or a scan of the front and back of my card my insurance lady ended up calling their billing department as a way call with me and used the provider option instead of the member option that i had to chose and she literally got someone on the phone in seconds my insurance lady ripped her a new one giving this lady all the information again which she said they did not have but my insurance lady said she had conformation that their billing department did have this information because there is records of the phone calls and information that was given to them this lady from the billing department had no idea what to say but took the information again you would think they would try to especially help people in this situation because it is dealing with mental health this was an absolute nightmare they are apparently getting it sorted out now but its already been months of this', 'this is the worst experience i ever had in my life after i showed my insurance card and the coverage letter from insurance company and asked if they are in network as i do not see them in insurance company website the doctor told me that yes they will cover as stated in my letter i received st bill stating all pending with insurance company but after weeks i received new bill stating that i am responsible i tried to call them but was told that i need to work with insurance company why should i be responsible with the wrong information provided by doctor in the middle i changed apartment and they directly sent my bill to collection company i tried to check with the doctor who gave me wrong information but i did not get any response this is the just start of my nightmare i tried to call the billing department since sep i explained to the billing department about my concern the manager asked me to send her the documents that i showed the doctor and said will check and get back to me after i sent all that info whenever i tired call billing department for months till end of times nobody pick up the phone and whenever that lady picks up the phone the way they talk is so rude to clarify seems someone newly joined in she sounds to be nice finally i got one updated letter with total amount not equal to the overall amount of bills they sent to me some service was billed twice i tried to call again to get explaination but unfortunately the manager was yelling at me and saying that i owe the money and i have to pay for it and saying that i am not planning to pay anything and disconnected the call i never said that i do not want to pay and i did make payment few months back but why should myself pay all with the wrong info provided by doctor my insurance would cover if i have gone to some other place if they have told me that they are not in network or she does not know i tried to get this resolved offline but seems it does not work i might need to go further with my attorney i have all the recordings and details just wondering how can a place providing service can be like this a very special place i ever see']"

other hand was quite terrible to put it honestly i came in with a clear birth plan and a list of questions to make sure we would be a good fit for each other i wanted to have a fully natural unmedicated water birth if everything went well everything went okay during the appointments and they agreed with my birth plan and answered the questions reassuringly i had transferred over from another state and had asked them to look over my file and confirm my due date since it had been changed different times the midwife told me she did not need to because it said the due date on the sheet of paper in front of her i explained that the due date printed on that form was just the latest one they had given me but i would really like to know how that was decided on since i wanted a water birth and if you are weeks or over you no longer have that option and having the wrong due date could really hurt those chances for me she refused to look into it for me on what they thought was about my week appt they checked my amniotic fluid and found that it was low so the midwife told me i needed to go to the hospital immediately and be induced when i said i wanted to go home and eat and drink some water since i had slept through my alarms and rushed over and wanted to think about it the miwdwife began to cry and asked me if i would be okay living the rest of my life knowing i killed my baby since that could happen if i did not get induced immediately i still did not feel right about it so i went home to gather my thoughts i was called multiple times during the day being asked when i was coming in to be induced which i responded that i had a gut feeling that i did not need to do that the next day i woke up to more phone calls feeling so pressured and not wanting to be responsible for my babys death i went in that evening and got induced the midwife told me she knew i did not want to be there but she did not want to be there either because her family was doing something together i felt like such an inconvenience the induction kicked in right away and i was up through the night with contractions the midwife had left so the nurse came and removed the cervidil since it was over stressing my baby all contractions stopped and the next midwife arrived late the next morning she told me the next plan of action was going to be pitocin and a possible csection i asked her if i could please leave because i could tell this was not right and my baby and my body were healthy and not ready to give birth yet she told me no and that she would not discharge me so my insurance would not cover any of my stay she began to cry again telling me again that my babys death would be my responsibility my mom then got my doula on the phone and put her on speaker phone she asked the midwife if she had retested my amniotic fluid since being admitted in since i had told the midwife and my doula that i had not drank or eaten anything the morning of the testing due to being so rushed that was obviously my fault the midwife was hesitant but said she would ask for a retest an hour later i was retested and my fluids could not have been healthier i then asked the midwife if i could go home and she said yes i asked her what her plan of action would be if i stayed now that my fluids were great and she said that she really had no plan then if i stayed and once again mentioned pitocin and a csection in passing i asked to be discharged which she then agreed tothe next day i transferred to teri gjerseth at sacred heart hospital with oakleaf she looked at my due date and figured out the one weeks later was in fact the correct one so i was only weeks when induced i went on to go into labor naturally about weeks later and had the fully unmedicated natural beautiful water birth of my dreams i now have a gorgeous and healthy baby and great post birth care', 'so i will start this off by saying my obgyn is amazing at azalea city physicians and had zero issues with her and only have the best things to say about her and her staff our experience started on january me and my husband went to labor and delivery that morning at am with contractions i was only weeks at the time i was not dilated and given medication to stop the contractions and was discharged i stopped having contractions and was given morphine to stop the pain my husband took me home and went to work and i slept until around when i received a phone call from springhills preregistration department i had preregistered online over a month before i received this call and even tried calling to talk to someone because a friend of mine told me that we would most likely have to pay our coinsurance beforehand me and my husband had to go through ivf to get pregnant and were a high risk pregnancy so we were going to have to have the baby delivered by scheduled csection to avoid uterine rupture or harm to the baby we knew when we would have the section and i called to pewregister as soon as i knew the datewell during one of our last doctors visits i asked my obgyn about not hearing from the hospital so we could find out how much we owed and she said not to worry about it that usually that meant insurance covered everything we had already paid our doctor bill for delivery and the deductible for so we stopped worrying about it a week before our scheduled csection and the day i came home on morphine for contractions preregistration calls and gets the normal information from me and then tells me that we owed for the hospital portion and asked if we could pay that day i told her no that after christmas and a week before our baby is due that few families have that much money on hand she said well if you cannot pay that then you are going to have to pay i asked if she was serious and that a hospital cannot call a week in advance and demand that money especially since i had preregistered almost months before she then told me that if i did not pay it that they would take me off the schedule for my csection and i would have to wait for my water to break for them to deliver my baby i even told her that i was high risk and that could not happen or my baby and myself would be at risk she said well i am just telling you what hospital policy is mind you they are billing me for services that have not been rendered yet and is only an estimate of services that may or may not be given me and the girl went back and forth and i started crying and telling her that we just wanted the hospital to do what is right and that they could not rightly expect a family to come up with that money in one week she said well if this is not going anywhere then i will just charge you for a csection because we were just trying to cut you a break by only charging you for a vaginal birth i was so upset i called my husband hysterically crying and trying to calm down because i was already having contractions the best word i can describe this girl was nasty and inconsiderate a little while later i got on the phone with insurance and the supervisor in the preregistration department and they finally agreed to let us pay what we could the friday before my csection i ended up in my doctors office the following morning dilated and contracting and ended up having to have my csection that day i fully believe that the stress caused by that department is the reason i ended up delivering our daughter at weeks springhill has a rd party that reaches out after you are discharged for a customer service survey and the girl i spoke to actually said that the girl was using scare tactics to collect the money and that it was illegal for her to threaten to take me off the schedule i am still considering legal action for that and many other things we experienced while our baby was in special care at springhill for days i breastfed every three hours in the nursery and we caught a nurse asleep holding someone elses baby', 'if this is your first pregnancy do not go here there is a lot of information to learn during your first pregnancy and your not always going to know what questions to ask during your visits granger medical located in riverton made us feel as they wanted to get us in and out a lot of people end up having this type of experience with doctors so it is not much of a suprise with my first experience at granger medical it was terrible they do ask if you are married or not which i did not think much of but when the doctor came into the room she made it really awkward i had my fianc in the room and instead of having a simple conversation with us to figure out who is who she awkwardly asked if he was blank blank the father of the baby i guess if i would of put down we were married she would not of had the opportunity to ask the way she did what if i was not with the person i was having a baby with and was embarrassed the doctor would of made it more obvious which could be hard for someone in that situation she also asked if we wanted a ultrasound but did not inform us that you typically only get a couple ultrasounds during the pregnancy and they can be expensive it was the beginning of my pregnancy and if i would of known what i do now about ultrasounds i would of waited from the first few minutes i met with my doctor i already knew there is no way i could trust this person to help me deliver a baby also they take your blood to check for a lot of things and i only was aware of that because i read about it however it still would of been nice to be communicated about what they check your blood for and why instead they just send you to another room to wait for your blood to get checked without much communication all of this was not even the worst part of the visit but the ultrasound was it was our first time so we did not know what to expect she started to do her thing and said nothing finally my partner had to ask what we were looking at or what she was doing it was then she told us oh that is your baby she was also aware that we did not know how far along we were and she did not share that information with us either i looked on the screen and noticed it said how many weeks so again we had to ask how far along we were to make sure overall it was not personable at all i had to find a place that was a lot more personable and informative i also turned down any place that asked if i was married or not because i did not want to give someone the opportunity to treat us any different i found a place that recommended the best insurance to have while pregnant and never asked about my relationship status also i found a midwife that took the time to call me after my second ultrasound to see if i had any questions or concerns if this is the type of care you are looking for i would not recommend granger medical

         "['i went to dr hendry after a car accident leaving me with a sore shoulder by the time i saw him it had been about months since the accident i had been to a chiropractor pt a normal family physician and a sports medicine orthopedic all of which told me a tear in the labrum when i went to dr hendry he said it had not been long enough it was only pinched nerves he did not believe in cortisone shots and that the pt i went to did not know anything he said i was looking for surgery to appease the attorney from the accident and i should not be listening to that advise attorney said no such thing i went to his pt that he gave me and went to the follow up appointment he said it still had not been long enough months post accident and he still thought it was a nerve i had no symptoms of a nerve issue only the tear he said the cortisone shot would do the trick i reminded him that he had said no shot before he said that if the shot worked the issue was my shoulder and we would let the shot wear off before we addressed the issue again could take months to wear off if the shot did not work it was a nerve i explained that it had been several months and i was losing sleep losing the ability to do normal everyday things with loss of motion and stability and muscle strength i was worried it was not going to improve he explained that he was only convinced anything was wrong and that he himself had reason to believe he needed shoulder surgery himself but did not want to waste the resources as he could live with it he said if i truly wanted surgery he would but he felt that he would go in and see nothing and it would be a waste of his time and resources literally he said this he did the cortisone shot and wanted a follow up appointment again i said no i would not make another i went to another specialist who saw me one time and knew it was torn he scheduled the surgery and sure enough the labrum was torn off the bone damage to the bicep tendon and damage to the rotator cuff some damage possibly from letting the injury last too long and trying to do pt on top of a shoulder coming out of place due to torn labrum i will never know if it would have been less damage if i had the surgery sooner but i do know that both times i saw dr hendry i left confused and frustrated i literally would feel like i was being a wuss and maybe it was in my head he had terrible bedside manner and was very condescending my appointments were a waste of his time and resources and he made sure i knew i will never go to his office again nor will i ever refer him to anyone i know i will be sure to let them know of my experience and help guide them away from him if they can', 'think twice before trusting dr walther please read this a little over a month ago i sustained what felt like a serious injury to my left knee playing tennis it was very painful and the pain did not go away so i called my primary care physician and he referred me to desert orthopedics i saw dr walther who examined my knee did xrays and concluded that it was simply arthritis i was surprised because this was a sudden very painful injury with sharp pain but she insisted that this is not uncommon for someone my age i am i play tennis and i ski and she said i could do both after one week of rest i waited two weeks and then played tennis again but after only about minutes on the court i jumped to hit an overhead and felt an excruciating pain in the left knee i fell to the court howling in terrific pain and had to be helped off the court it felt like the first injury only this time it was much more painful i went back to desert orthopedics and this time i saw dr hoblet he said that i probably had a meniscus tear but would need an mri to confirm it he claimed that the two injuries were not related but i did not believe him so i sought a second opinion at the center i saw a doctor there and he confirmed my suspicion that this was most likely a reinjury of the same problem not an unrelated second injury now i have several problems with this knee torn mcl torn acl meniscus tears contusions and so on i do not yet know the full extent to the problem but it is very clear to me that this is a going to cost me a lot of money and b negatively impact my quality of living and ability to play sports which i love dr walther should have ordered an mri after my first injury since she did not she failed to properly diagnose my condition leaving me in the bad shape i am in nowbarely able to walk and with the future health of my knee very much in doubt also trying to get your medical records or make any sort of contact with a doctor or nurse at this place is a challenge to say the least and when i mentioned this debacle to a friend he said he also had a bad experience with her thankfully for him he sought a second opinion before she could do any more damage to his shoulder i was not as lucky i recieved a phone call from dr walther a few weeks later and my opinion of her sunk even lower than before she tried to tell me that when she examind me i had no pain and no swelling completely preposterous then she says so if you thought your injury was severe why did not you order the mri why did not i order an mri you are the doctor i do not have a medical degree i trusted and paid you to know what to do when i disputed the notion that it was my job to selfdiagnose she said i do not have to deal with crazy patients like you every doctor makes mistakes but an honest one will at least own up to them', 'i was referred to this office after spending over years going to regular drs and physical therapist and a chiropractor in the beginning the had xrays and a scan done on my lower back they shortly started me on pain medication which took some getting used to but at least was treating the pain so i could sleep at night then a few months later they did an injection which actually worked for two weeks i could sleep until i tried to help a lady one day and try and push her car which sent me too the er another scan and more pain medicine followed up with injections in areas that were not even areas that bothered me and were no help at one point my insurance lapses and i still paid to have them continue to inject me and then they went in and burned the nerves in my back this only caused my butt to burn and be numb for several months this year i was assigned a new dr due to what i believe was a lot of them retiring or just leaving my first visit with dr hutchinson felt more like a trip to a fast food restaurant having never seen him before he spoke to me for maybe a minute the exam was a mere sec and then he stated i would be a good candidate for an experimental implant and told me i need to make a decision that week in talking with the consoler doing the new device i realized i did not fit the bill and if this did not work i would have this battery and device in me forever i asked dr hutchinson about the fact that if it did not work that i would want it removed he stated that it was not an issue leaving it in upon this visit he cut my dose by one pill a day and scheduled me for another mri which cost me another that scan showed a bulging disc below my neck where i was not even having pain they had ordered this scan in the wrong area and told me it was not an issue my next visit a month later was even shorter with him ordering another mri and telling me he was going to reduce my medication another pill a day which was very hard to do considering i had been on it for over years as well i got another injection which amazingly worked for a couple days it is what i was not told that was written on the bottle was a taper schedule down from pills to a day over weeks i figured out about weeks in what they had done years i have been on this medication at some point i had them reduce the strength because i felt it was too much my last visit a hell month later they told me the mri showed two more bulging discs in my lower back but they were not severe enough to cause my pain i did not see the dr just a nurse when i told her about the injection working for a few days she said i would probably be getting another one scheduled she then walked out to inform the dr about the injection findings and ask about the medication upon her return she informed me to schedule the injection and that he would be prescribing any medication so now i get to not only attemp to go cold turkey but will basically be getting zero sleep at night due to my back and spend much of my mornings in pain to top it off when i went to the desk to schedule my injection the only thing the dr had put in the system was a follow up months later i did not schedule because i knew what they were doing i just asked for a copy of my records and walked out in pain with zero plan of what i would do nothing better than being in chronic pain for years spending over k of my own money to do almost anything to get better and to be basically shown the door at a center that is there to manage pain the doctors there do not care it is all about how many drug screens how many injections and how many customers can they shuffle through the doors every day before you judge me also know i was bitten in by a lone star tick and was the th person in the us to contract the heartland virus which is way way worse than lyme disease i made it through heart attacks i have a loving wife and two kids and own my own business and have seven employees i work my butt off every day to provide for my family']"

         "['after my years in team sports i knew that going to a regular gym by myself would not bring me the results i desired from previous experience i knew a personal trainer from a big name gym was not worth the time or money so i started my search for a local gym with a more personal feel thankfully it did not take me long to find amplified fitness after one meeting with thomas i knew i had found what i was looking for a gym where i could get the feeling and encouragement from a team of others who truly cared about my fitness goals and that would help me achieve those goals through proper technique i attended the amplified fitness strength and conditioning class for months during my last semester and i could not be more pleased with the results i lost just over lbs and increased my squat and bench max reps by lbs both thomas and chris have the knowledge and care to help those with their fitness goals and i would personally recommend them to anyone looking for a gym and trainers with real knowledge and a personal touch', 'i was a member at charm city crossfit for over a year prior to that i was involved in crossfit and this was not my first experience in crossfit when i i first came to baltimore from arizona i started looking for a nearby crossfit gym to continue my workouts like i used to in az cccf was very close to where i live so i decided to give this place a visit i first met nick the ownertrainer at this gym he seemed nice showed me around in the gym told me about different classes that they have and different hours and most importantly open gym hours which for me was a big deal given my job and the fact that my schedule will not let me attend most of the classesthey only have few anyway nick said that in between classes i am welcome to drop in and do my own workout at this gym which was again a deal breaker for me so i signed up few months went by and i realized that what nick said was not completely true they only had one or two open hour for members in the entire week when the class starts you must join the class and stop your workoutthis was so ridiculous beside that on the weekend when most people have the most amount of free time to go to gym they have only one class on saturdays and that is it one hour on saturday where you must do the class with all the members in this tinny gym and guess what they close on sundays other classes that they claim to have such as yoga etc they are most of time with no one to actually coach so they stopped most of them i finally realized that i am paying a month for days a week classes that i was not able to attended most of the time due to my schedule which was fine because i already know my schedule but the open gym lie is huge and the fact that you must take the class when you are there and cannot do your own thing is also very ridiculous not to mention the small space to workout no places for wall balls in the gym at all only few places where you can do pull ups because the rooftop in some places is lower that other no place for muscle ups i had to wake nick up multiple times to actually open the gym during the few open hours that they have because he was sleeping a lot of members and trainers started to leave this gym then i finally realized that this place was nothing but a total ripoff', 'beautiful exterior beautiful interior beautiful people i was visiting salem yesterday and wanted to get a workout in for the day and opened my phone to discover this gym upon arrival i was a little lackluster to see how small the gym as compared to other ones i have been to oh how wrong was i to judge a book by its cover the doors at the entrance into the building are freaking automatic some may say who cares well i do because having those doors not only shows the level of quality of the gym but do you know how freaking inconvenient it is to hold the door open for people when enter or exiting a gym anyways i was surprised to see how nice the person was behind the front desk i never caught her name but the customer service i received was x better than the people i have dealt with at hour fitness la fitness and portland state university the questions i had about the gym were answered kindly and i was even offered to be given a tour around the facility as well the gym is huge if you look at the photos i posted of the entrance it is a lot bigger than it looks in real life now i am not going to be a fanboy and completely bias the interior of the gym may be spacious and wide the number of equipment and machines the gym had was disappointing considering the price that you pay for a membership is a month the weight room contains only two power racks that are also used for bench pressing as well there are two more power racks but they are in the personal trainer room and can only be used if there is no session in progress the machines are fairly new they use the same kind of machines that planet fitness uses there is a decent amount of treadmills and stationary bikes in their own separate rooms but not much more cardio machines when compared to commercial gyms like planet fitness and la fitness the last part i want to mention is the community the community is amazing the employees and the members i have spoken to were are too friendly i do not know if it is because people in salem are super nice or if it is the vibe coming from the gym itself but i was blown away the niceness is on par with planet fitness and hyatt hotel gyms and hundreds of miles beyond better than hour fitness la fitness and portland state university overall i was very pleased with my visit and workout at courthouse fitness and i would highly recommend all my friends and family to try it out']"

appointment today i live in ogden valley and there was a huge snow storm last night and this morning it usually would take me about mins to get to the dr office i left myself an extra ten mins on commute time and left min early i soon realized that the roads in my town were not cleared yet and the traffic was going very slowly i called the office to inform them that i may be a little late they transferred me to the dermatologist receptionist again and i informed them i ended up only being about mins late but upon checkin the receptionist informs me that this appointment is in a completely different location are you kidding me would have been nice to know this i rush to the new location i was given and ended up being about minutes late for my appt i explained all of this to the receptionist and was very apologetic but this was really just a case of bad communication from the receptionappointment setter this is where it gets worse i was made to wait in the waiting room for almost an hour after my arrival time at least people who came after me went in before me i finally mentioned something to the receptionist who then said she assumes that it is because i was late i asked her to please find out how much longer it would be she said i would be next and they were just waiting for a room to open up apparently the other rooms that were filled before me did not suffice finally an assistant comes to the waiting room to call for me she had a horrible attitude and seemed very annoyed we entered the room i had my purse and an cup full of ice water because i am months pregnant i set them on the counter and the assistant says you need to move this it is the only area i have to workso rude i said okay where would you like me to set them she points to a chair next to an unsanitary waste bin she then asks me what i am there for i told her a cancer screening and possible removals she said your insurance does not cover removals anymore and just stared at me i said okay thenmaybe i can make a separate appointment she then says yes you can do that after i mean i have worked in the medical industry in hospital administration in los angeles for years this is horrible bedside manner she made me feel like i was an inconvenience after i waited an hour for a min cancer screen and like i did not have enough money to pay out of pocket for uncovered services boy is she mistaken i was instructed to put a gown on and crack the door when i was ready i did and then heard her talking to the dr in the hallway trying to explain i assume why i waited so long for this appointment she of course blamed me i am not surprised and told him i was so late let me explain something i hate being late that is why i called multiple times to keep the office informed the reasons i had for being late were completely out of my control not to mention my husband worked until am this morning and i woke him up hours early to watch the kids so i could come to this appointment it would be nice if staff could take a moment to breath and think about the possibility of circumstances beyond a patients control and certainly do not punish me for being late i called min before my appointment and communicated the issues if they did not want to see me then at that point let me know anyways of course the second the dr was in our presence the assistant was terribly sweet and personable hah let me tell you something doc she is not like that one on one it is a show and i personally felt completely offended appalled and badly for other patients the dr however was amazing dr hadley', 'i wish i could give zero stars i scheduled my appointment weeks ago from today to be in days from now when i scheduled i did not think to ask for a telehealth appointment instead given the covid situation and the fact that utah has been seeing k cases a day called friday the th to have it switched from in person to virtual spoke to a gal in the office who seemed confused about the actual request so she said she would have to put me on hold for minutes because there was a conflict with the schedule i asked what she meant and she said that someone else had scheduled another patient on my same time after being put on hold once she came back to tell me they needed to move me and i said no i had schedule the appointment prior to the other patient and i should not have to be moved because they decided to overbook the doctor stewart she then wanted to put me on hold again but i asked for a call back instead she never called me back monday called them back at am and spoke to mariah at the front desk she said that she needed to speak to the manager christie about it because it seemed that no one fixed the issue but that is he would not be in until the afternoon i said that i did not mind waiting on a call back so long as they did call me back never called me back today called them back again and spoke to sydney at the front desk explained the same thing and how no one has called me back yet she transferred me to the ghost manager christie and she had an attitude from the get go saying i told you when i schedule you back then that we do in office visit i said that is intuitive it is after all a doctors office she then said we do not do telehealth mind you that when you go to their website it says that they do indeed offer telehealth i am a new patient so i would have qualified for this option but she said they do not offer it i asked why then no one told me this during the days i have been calling to get that service and she said because they simply did not get around it she then slipped and said i was just old this yesterday by doctor stewart i asked why then did not she call me to tell mepause because i did not know you called for this i asked why would you feel the need to ask him the if you did not know i called just for that she said i did not ask just for you long story short they are a bunch of liars and super unprofessional they will waste your time and they do not care about your health i cannot go in in person because of a medical condition that puts me at a higher risk for covid but they do not give two figs about it find another doctor', 'a few months back i tried calling this office to make an appointment the girl who answered the phone told me i would need a referral i told her i do not i work for my health insurance company after some haggling she said ok what are my symptoms so i started giving her my run down when i got to balance issues she said i needed a referral she would not let me make the appointment with out it so at this point i cannot even get in the next day i called my doctor in another state then i called this office to let them know he was going to reach out i got a different girl on the phone they did not have the referral yet she made me an appointment immediately no problem i reached back out to the doctor who was going to do a referral to let him know i did not need it i saw the doctor and he ordered an mri after the mri i was told to make a follow up appointment i called to make the appointment i got that girl on the phone again she refused to make my appointment told me she would send a message to the nurse a day or two later the nurse called she said they would send me to another provider in their office or somewhere else for a nd opinion i never got a first do not go here they do not seem to have time for their patients and they have a front desk person who seems to want to deny patients from seeing the doctor almost for this appointment and for the mri not cool']"
