         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

         "Don’t go to CAPS. I was left completely unsatisfied by the care I received from my CAPS psychiatrist during my senior year. I left her care in worse shape than when I first saw her. I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

         "This place is a complete JOKE!!!! I have been there 3 times. The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill.

But I had bad experiences with CAPS, particularly their greediness and lack of really understanding. Not to mention their use of grad students as counselors. Find good mental health counselors can be hard, and CAPS is not the place for it.\n\nEdited a year and half later:\nI discovered I'm trans and there were plenty of chances for the 3 different counselors I met with to help me figure this out. Instead I went through a hell of suicidal thoughts and depression before finally figuring it out for myself. Shout out to Ryan Burchfield and Meghan Werner. These two community counselors (in Rogers and Fayetteville, respectively) helped me a ton. See one of them if you think you may be non-binary or trans or in the lgbtq+ community and need counseling.",

Sat there for probably 45 mins or so with no movement in the office, I finally called 20 mins or so after my appointment was supposed to start. After two awkward holds I was asked to reschedule.

I am so upset with my service, I went with my whole family and the service my sister and I received were ridiculous. My nails were full of air bubbles, under my nails were rough (I got a gel mani and spa pedi), most of my nails weren’t colored in all the way and when I asked the technician to fix it, she said the color will come off and that it looks fine. The person my sister had made her very upset by breaking one of her toe nails which led to her not being able to get a French manicure and leaving the place very upset. I will never go there again and would never recommend anyone to go there as well. If you need to go somewhere, go to lovely nails. Atleast the male owner knows how to do his job unlike the one at AQ nails.",

Every time I go to get adjustments I feel better no matter how bad my muscle tension was before. Thank you!!",

They do not provide a clear summary of procedures and costs up front like other dentists, such as 9th East Dental, do. Instead, they performed unwanted procedures on me without informing me, and then later sent me a bill asking for money. When I complained about the bill, the receptionist lied to my face and said they clearly informed me of the procedures and charges. If I have the money to sue them I would.\n- They also make you sign a contract that gives them all the rights to charge you compound interest if you have unpaid overdue. I didn't have to sign something like this in the two other dentists that I went to in Provo.\n- The 5-star ratings you see are not true. Every time they get a 1-star review they cover it with fake positive reviews. You can tell all good reviews are done by the same person just by how the 5-star reviews follows a pattern and is very general and vague.

The girl who was doing it told me she had an appointment after mine and couldn’t do a full color and highlights which, was a complete lie since the receptionist told me the day I made my appointment that I was the last one. Then she has the nerve to try and charge my to dye my eyebrows along with my hair. The remaining dye would have been discarded. I’ve never in my 25 years ever had someone refuse to dye my eyebrows with the remaining dye. Especially not charge me extra for it. I walked out. I’ll won’t go back nor ever recommend them. Complete joke!\n\nBy the owners response, it seems to be my fault they shorted me on my appointment time. Good to know. I took off work off early to make this appointment all for nothing.",

Bryum is the worst healthcare product providers ever i recently ordered a dexcom start up package and its been a mess! I have had diabetes for 25 years now and never had such a hard time getting answers or even a call back! A \"sales rep\" if you will set up my order i tried to call to change my shipping address 3 times, left voicemails and even sent an email. My order was shipped any way i never received a call back still to this day & that was weeks ago... luckily it showed up i live in a very rural area and most cant find our house which was why i wanted something so expensive shipped elsewhere so it didnt come up missing. I have submitted numerous request to talk about the billing and never received a call back or email. They shipped the product to me and i received it before my insurance was ever billed what would have happened if it wasnt covered? Then they billed my insurance 4700+ dollars but originally quoted that they would bill my insurance 2270 which is what their online invoice reflects. Finally today i got a hold of someone who would actually look at it she said they bill insurance the retail price but have some kind of contracted price arranged with them? This would have been nice to know at the beginning because my cost (20%) of that 4700 vs the 2270 is not something i am prepared for on top of having to buy a new pump this month since animas sold out. Over all the most frustrating part of all of this is the lack of customer service a simple call back would have even been nice saying hey we have received your request we are working on that now and will be in touch or a call back from my \"personal sales rep\"",

I am so upset with my service, I went with my whole family and the service my sister and I received were ridiculous. My nails were full of air bubbles, under my nails were rough (I got a gel mani and spa pedi), most of my nails weren’t colored in all the way and when I asked the technician to fix it, she said the color will come off and that it looks fine. The person my sister had made her very upset by breaking one of her toe nails which led to her not being able to get a French manicure and leaving the place very upset. I will never go there again and would never recommend anyone to go there as well. If you need to go somewhere, go to lovely nails.

         "We brought my dog in to NW Vet Specialists very early in the morning, like 3:30am, after she had her first ever seizure or \"brain event\".  During the visit it was determined that she was also suddenly blind.  She was obviously distressed and wobbly.  As we sat with the doctor discussing options - the most serious of which was euthanasia - the very loud floor buffers started up.  It freaked her out, she became more agitated.  As we mulled over the hard decision to put her down, the buffer distressed all of us.  The saddest part was that once we decided to go forward with euthanasia and we were walking back to the table to do it, the floor buffer was louder than ever in the room right next to us.  I was crying and I said to the Vet \"That is very loud.\"  The Vet, who was about to administer euthanasia, said \"Oh it's floor cleaning night!\"  Really?  My dog is about to die and there is no thought that the floor buffer should be turned off for quick few minutes?  If I had not been so wracked with grief and despair because I was about to lose my beloved old girl, I would have told them to turn the buffer machine off... for LESS THAN 5 MINUTES... that's about how long it took.\n\nAs the euthanasia happened, the Vet and the Vet Technician had to yell over to each other for the injections and instructions.  They couldn't hear each other.  My dog was visibly upset... and then they couldn't find a vein, so she was stuck multiple times (I don't blame them for this, but for any being to endure this pain - human or canine - to be afraid, distressed, and stuck with painful needles - ALL WHILE A LOUD MACHINE IS GRINDING AWAY right there... well that is just wrong.  Wrong.  To put a dog down while it so loud that those administering the euthanasia can't even hear each other talk... well just imagine how unnerving that was to my poor dog and me.  It is not the way to go and I am sorry that I chose NW Vet Specialists to take my dog.\n\nNote: I understand that the cleaning crew is hired on an hourly basis and they have to do their work while they are there -- and this hospital is a 24 hour operation so at some point \"the cleaning must go on\".  But as far as I could see, we were the only patients in the house (other than the dogs in the kennels) and we were putting a dog down to DIE.  Would LESS than 5 minutes have caused such a problem for them to halt the buffer?  Would their books have suffered that much?  I think not. I am terribly disappointed with this hospital and sadly I will not return.  I have brought 2 sick dogs into their care for years... as far back as 2007.  My last two visits in the last 6 months (including this one) were awful.  This was my last visit and I will tell anyone who wants to know what happened to us there.",

However, I'm not sorry for explaining the importance of reading a contract before you're burned like myself. During the holidays money is tight for everyone. To not be told that I still had a balance, or even an additional payment, is irresponsible for someone departing. Thank you again to the coaches involved with my daughter.",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.

After filling out the paperwork and being seen I was told that due to my insurance I would need to get authorization, not a surprise.\n\nWhat was a surprise was when I got called two weeks later that while I was approved there was an issue, the procedure could only be done in their surgical center and their center was not taking my insurance.\n\nThe staff should of known of this issue not let me find this out after I had already driven up there for an eval. This wasnt a what can you do for me visit, this visit was made with clear expectations of pursuing the procedure.\n\nAfter learning they don't take insurance I backed away from the procedure but they informed me they would pursue getting their center into the insurance program, that it would take a couple of months and that they would call me.\n\nFast forward to October of 2016, no calls. I reached out to them to learn that 1)no one knew if the center was in the program and 2) no one had it written down to reach out to me.\n\nI was told they would call me back within a day or two.\nTwo weeks later and 3 calls from me I finally got my call back. I was informed that united only gives out applications for a limited number of centers so they were out of luck. However they would call me back in 1 to 2 days to see if they could do the procedure in the office.\n\nAs you can guess no call received and not only that it took me to call them in November to learn they were no longer doing the procedure.\n\nI've not seen failure on this level in a long time.",

         "We brought my dog in to NW Vet Specialists very early in the morning, like 3:30am, after she had her first ever seizure or \"brain event\".  During the visit it was determined that she was also suddenly blind.  She was obviously distressed and wobbly.  As we sat with the doctor discussing options - the most serious of which was euthanasia - the very loud floor buffers started up.  It freaked her out, she became more agitated.  As we mulled over the hard decision to put her down, the buffer distressed all of us.  The saddest part was that once we decided to go forward with euthanasia and we were walking back to the table to do it, the floor buffer was louder than ever in the room right next to us.  I was crying and I said to the Vet \"That is very loud.\"  The Vet, who was about to administer euthanasia, said \"Oh it's floor cleaning night!\"  Really?  My dog is about to die and there is no thought that the floor buffer should be turned off for quick few minutes?  If I had not been so wracked with grief and despair because I was about to lose my beloved old girl, I would have told them to turn the buffer machine off... for LESS THAN 5 MINUTES... that's about how long it took.\n\nAs the euthanasia happened, the Vet and the Vet Technician had to yell over to each other for the injections and instructions.  They couldn't hear each other.  My dog was visibly upset... and then they couldn't find a vein, so she was stuck multiple times (I don't blame them for this, but for any being to endure this pain - human or canine - to be afraid, distressed, and stuck with painful needles - ALL WHILE A LOUD MACHINE IS GRINDING AWAY right there... well that is just wrong.  Wrong.  To put a dog down while it so loud that those administering the euthanasia can't even hear each other talk... well just imagine how unnerving that was to my poor dog and me.  It is not the way to go and I am sorry that I chose NW Vet Specialists to take my dog.\n\nNote: I understand that the cleaning crew is hired on an hourly basis and they have to do their work while they are there -- and this hospital is a 24 hour operation so at some point \"the cleaning must go on\".  But as far as I could see, we were the only patients in the house (other than the dogs in the kennels) and we were putting a dog down to DIE.  Would LESS than 5 minutes have caused such a problem for them to halt the buffer?  Would their books have suffered that much?  I think not. I am terribly disappointed with this hospital and sadly I will not return.  I have brought 2 sick dogs into their care for years... as far back as 2007.  My last two visits in the last 6 months (including this one) were awful.  This was my last visit and I will tell anyone who wants to know what happened to us there.",

         "Just as some previously have stated: I don't like leaving negative reviews, especially when I leave a good review prior (which I was asked in a very pushy way to do by Tony before my daughter's departure) . Just as others have stated, yet again, the classes and coaches are great, the business side of this whole academy is a mess. My 13 year old daughter, who is trying to find herself mind you, decided after 3 or 4 months to stop. I come to find out there's a 696 dollar cancelation fee. When I made mention of my current financial situation, Tony assured me that he was waving it and my daughter was welcome back anytime. Right on. However, this was done the Monday of Thanksgiving, before the next pay period should have gone through. To my shock, right on time as it always did, I was charged for jiu jitsu again (even after canceling). I was then given the information that because I didn't give a 30 day notice of leaving that they would not be able to give me my money back as the pay period fell in that 30 days. I just want to thank Tony for not allowing me to buy groceries or Christmas presents for my kids through these practices.\n\nBeware.\n\nRead the contract carefully and keep in mind all of these fees if your child is a teenager and doesn't know what she wants right now.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI appreciate the reply by the school. Obviously me telling my story about my experience (which you don't deny) and made it a point to read the contract carefully. If you find this to be bad mouthing, then I do beg your pardon. However, I'm not sorry for explaining the importance of reading a contract before you're burned like myself. During the holidays money is tight for everyone.

         "My significant other had to have an extraction, crown removal and eventual implant.  The initial visits were very informative and the referral to the endodontist was very professional.  When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

         "This review is of Dr. Chad Lundstrom.  It is not related Dr. Sato, massage therapists, or office personnel at Lundstrom Chiropractic. I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

         "Wow. The billing department is dishonest. Listen to me and others when we warn you to NOT COME HERE. It is not worth your time or the hassle you will probably be dealing with months later.\nI brought my daughter in for her first check up. I paid at the time of service in full, out of pocket-no insurance. 3.5 months later I get a bill saying I owe more money. I called and it took a lot of back and forth phone tag for someone to finally figure out what I was being charged for. I was being charged for THEIR MISTAKE!!! They said, oops we charged you as a return patient instead of a new patient so you owe us the difference that these visits cost.\nThey should have had better customer service and just eaten the cost. It wasn’t even that much. But it’s a matter of principle. Looks like they make these kinds of mistakes very frequently, charging others hundreds of extra dollars and expecting their patients to pay for the billing department’s mistakes. Oh, and then when you try and get it resolved, they will lie to you saying that the person in charge will call you but they won’t. They will write a cowardly email instead saying that you still owe them money and if you don’t pay it then interest will also be tacked on.\nIf you want to avoid dealing with liars and thieves, stay away from this office.\nThey will also write a robot response to this review saying they want to make things better and to contact them. They won’t many anything better. I already tried contacting the COO. They just want their dirty money. They lost all of my future business.",

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

The nursing staff is wonderful and accomodating. The ED has been updating the building and it looks very nice. Zero odors, ever. The food is good and hot when delivered on halls as staff completes test trays often to ensure palatability. The Food and Nutrition Manager is always implementing new programs to make the residents feel at home -- ice cream socials, homemade bread to make the dining room smell good, omelet and waffle stations. Overall this is a great facility and I would absolutely place my family member here if needed.",

They had wrestled it away from him injuring (cutting)his finger and bruising him. They said that he kept pushing the button. Totally unacceptable. When I left the night before at 9 pm, I left his cell phone along with a pad that had my number and my brothers written down on the tray table next to his bed. When I got there, both had been moved to a desk in his room that again he couldn’t reach. I would hire a sitter if your loved one is ever has to be in this facility, especially at night. Beware of the night nurses. I have names of them if needed.",

We told them from the beginning that we had gotten a 30-day notice from the assisted living facility to complete the transfer. Dedra, the admissions director, was never in when we called and never returned even ONE of my more than a dozen phone calls. When I went to the facility in person, she was never there and her assistant, Paula, acted as if she was bored to tears by everything I said and could not have cared less about our problems. Finally, when we were on day 24 of our 30 days and Dedra still had not done the face-to-face interview with my MIL to determine if they could take her, we gave up and chose another nursing home. I've known people who had relatives at Mobile Nursing and Rehab who were very happy with the nursing care, but the administration and admissions personnel are terrible. They made an already painful and stressful time for us even worse.",

My mother was in a halo of rine and there were no supplies in the room, she is a tube feeder and the aid tried to put her head down all the way until I reminder her that she was a tube feeder and that wasnt suppose to happen, no gloves no barrier and the trash was over flowing, the TV was off and lights were off in the room, I'd not recommend this facility to anyone other than the state and that would be under the suggestion to shut them down, VERY POOR QUALITY OF CARE BEWARE!!!",

         "I've had very mixed experiences with Pat Walker, but I haven't felt the urge to leave a review until today.\n\nThe only reason I am giving them more than 1 star is because of Dr. Acosta. He is a fantastic and friendly doctor, and I am extremely grateful that he thought to test me for Celiac disease. I came to Pat Walker several times over 2 years due to strange and chronic symptoms, and tried a few different doctors. Until Dr. Acosta, none could put the pieces together. One doctor even told me it was just anxiety, and that I should \"lay off the energy drinks\" (which I don't drink). It was extremely condescending and disheartening. Turns out I just need to lay off the gluten!\n\nToday, I had an appointment with the Women's Clinic at 1:30. Being an off campus student, I left my apartment an hour before my scheduled time and drove 25 minutes in a torrential downpour. Pat Walker only offers about 6 patient parking spots, which were all occupied. From 1 pm to 1:30 pm, I drove all around searching for parking to no avail. There were no available spots on the street, nor in the Garland parking deck. I was forced to cancel my appointment.\n\nWhile this was unfortunate, the woman who handled my phone call was even more unfortunate. I was extremely stressed when I called her to ask her to cancel my appointment due to no available parking. Rather than being sympathetic at all, she came across as incredibly annoyed. Exasperated, I asked if Pat Walker was planning on adding any more patient parking spots (since they have been continuously doing construction for almost a year now). She responded \"No, our parking is LIM-I-TED,\" as if I am hard of hearing. She told me I should have tried arriving earlier, as if leaving an hour before my scheduled appointment is not enough?\n\nMy issue is this: I am a stressed client, trying to seek medical help, and I was unable to find parking. I was treated like a nuisance by the staff. Even IF the staff feels that it's normal and justified for a clinic to offer only 6 measly parking spots for off-campus clients (which personally, I don't), the least they can do is respond in a sympathetic manner. Pat Walker's staff exacerbated an already stressful situation.",

         "Don’t go to CAPS. I was left completely unsatisfied by the care I received from my CAPS psychiatrist during my senior year. I left her care in worse shape than when I first saw her. I was condescended to on every occasion I met with her, and goaded into taking medications that I was unsure about. The way they run things is borderline draconian. When I voiced concerns about the medications I was treated as though I was being irrational and uncooperative. If you miss appointments and don’t give any notice, (particularly if you miss multiple in a row) they will likely never agree to meet with you again. The only positives were Nurse Patty (very nice lady), and some of the counselors are great. If you really need help and CAPS is you’re only option for whatever reason, I would meet with a counselor and have them refer you to a psychiatrist not affiliated with the University. I promise you will be better for it.\n\n(CAPS absolutely deserves one star, but because this is Pat a walker as a whole and I’ve had less problems elsewhere in the building I am giving it two stars.)",

He advised that I go to Pat Walker to seek help and I set an appointment.\n\nI waited about two weeks. I set an appointment for 10am, but apparently that means your appointment is for 9:30am for paperwork (it must be enough paperwork for a house purchase!).\n\nThe morning of, I left my house early and arrived at the campus at 9:30am. Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

         "The CAPS Program:\n\nI’ve battled depression for years after my brother passed away and even my professor expressed concern because I was missing class due to it. He advised that I go to Pat Walker to seek help and I set an appointment.\n\nI waited about two weeks. I set an appointment for 10am, but apparently that means your appointment is for 9:30am for paperwork (it must be enough paperwork for a house purchase!).\n\nThe morning of, I left my house early and arrived at the campus at 9:30am. Parking was horrendous, as you can assume. So, after walking all the way across campus at arriving there at 9:50, I am met with a receptionist that tells me that since I was not there at 9:30am, my appointment was cancelled and I’d have to make another one for two weeks in advance!\n\nListen, I know I wasn’t early early, but I’ve never heard of anyone cancelling your appointment for being there in advance?? If you want me there at 9:30, make my appointment at that time. If I’m early to MY APPOINTMENT TIME, why is it being cancelled?\n\nI’ll add to the fact that there was NO one in the waiting room. This place is a joke. I made an appointment but I was so upset and discouraged that I just threw the reminder card in the trash. I don’t mind paying for help that is actually effective and doesn’t cancel appointments for early arrivals.",

         "This place is a complete JOKE!!!! I have been there 3 times. The first time I went there they would not give me medicine and when they did blood work they didn't know how to draw blood and stuck me 4 or 5 times. I actually wound up in the hospital a week later due to the lack of proper treatment and help for what I had. The most recent time I went was this Wednesday. I went up there because I woke up with my voice completely gone, dry coughing, very sore throat, upset stomach, temperature of 99.6, body aches, head ache, and felt very weak. The \"Doctor\" I saw refused to do test on me to make sure it wasn't something else saying it was the common cold. I fought with her telling her I know my body very well and I know this is not the common cold. Long story short I left with no help. You would think that they would do everything they could to ensure a student isn't contagious so it is not spread to the whole college. I left a message with the supervisor and have yet to receive a call. My mom will be calling the university to complain. This is unacceptable of a doctors office and I along with many other people I have talked to said they will not be back unless something is fixed.\nI ended up getting an appointment at another doctors office and when I went in the doctor immediately knew it was strep by looking at the back of my throat and were in shock that a doctor didn't see that. He did a test to ensure it was and they came back positive. He also said I am having flu like symptoms and to be resting, drinking a lot of fluid and take my antibiotic for 10 days so my strep does not get worse as well as taking medicine to keep my fever down.",

         "well i could’ve died (it really felt like i was) bc of how one of the doctors didn’t prescribe me the medicine i asked for back in October. Dr. Susan Raben-Taylor seemed to listen to me until i asked for prednisone, which treats bronchitis. i always get prednisone when i get really bad bronchitis and need it for bronchitis especially since i’m asthmatic. i’d had a really bad cold that turned into severe bronchitis and when i asked for the prescription she said “no, we’re not going to do that.” and that was the end of that. she ended up giving me a regular rescue inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler that she said would help the inflammation in my lungs. well it didn’t bc as an asthmatic would know, corticosteroid inhalers take weeks to start working so it was pointless to begin with. i got it anyways and as expected it didn’t work, but gave me minor oral thrush on my tongue so that was a wasted $60.\nFast forward to fall break and I ended up getting pleurisy (which is basically one step away from pneumonia) and it hurt to take deep breaths, cough, laugh, sneeze, move around when trying to fall asleep, etc. When I say hurt I mean INTENESE PAIN. It felt like someone was stabbing me over and over again when i would have to cough (since the bronchitis was still there.) When I coughed, I couldn’t do it standing up, I had to sit down or kneel over because of how bad the pain was. The lining of my lungs was severely inflamed WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED had I been prescribed prednisone. But noooo, the doctors “know best.” Umm excuse me but have you been in another person’s body and know it like the actual person does? I know my body and knew I needed prednisone.\nAnyways, the pleurisy lasted all of fall break, and I went back to PWHC, this time to Dr. Deborah Deere, who was an angel and felt my rib cage and lungs and ordered a chest x ray to make sure i didn’t have pneumonia since i was complaining of pain so much. They didn’t see pneumonia but wrote me antibiotics just in case and Dr. Deere told me to take ibuprofen since there wasn’t anything much else they could do since I was far into having pleurisy already. I ended up having the pleurisy for about 2 weeks before the pain finally went away. Lemme tell you when i had it i was scared to even go to sleep bc i was terrified of waking up and not being able to breathe, that’s how bad it hurt. Long story short (lol apologies for how long this rant ended up being) this all could have been avoided if the first doctor had given me the medication i asked for since it is after all my body and i know how it works and its limits and breaking points. People know their own dang bodies, don’t try and act like you know better bc you have the title of doctor on your name.\n\nNeedless to say, be careful choosing your doctors at PWHC. I recommend Dr. Deere or Dr. Howerton. Both are angels and seem to genuinely care about their patients.",

         "I went to Pat Walker after complete dissatisfaction at Med Express, so clearly Pat Walker was better in comparision. I'm giving 4 stars because the MD had good bedside manner, was thorough (still waiting on a referral however), and checked up on me through the patient portal website. The phlebotomist did a good job- he drew 5+ vials of blood and I barely felt it since he did a pretty good job making chit chat to distract me. My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill. Granted, I had to make an appointment and I waited a loonggggg time to be seen, but I was much more comfortable with the competency of those around me.",

But I had bad experiences with CAPS, particularly their greediness and lack of really understanding. Not to mention their use of grad students as counselors. Find good mental health counselors can be hard, and CAPS is not the place for it.\n\nEdited a year and half later:\nI discovered I'm trans and there were plenty of chances for the 3 different counselors I met with to help me figure this out. Instead I went through a hell of suicidal thoughts and depression before finally figuring it out for myself. Shout out to Ryan Burchfield and Meghan Werner. These two community counselors (in Rogers and Fayetteville, respectively) helped me a ton. See one of them if you think you may be non-binary or trans or in the lgbtq+ community and need counseling.",

The office is awkwardly setup and I looked around, there was no one in the office. I took a seat in the office, noticed there was an Arlo camera in the corner, I felt better about not seeing anyone because Arlo sends notifications to your phone to let you know when motion was detected.  Sat there for probably 45 mins or so with no movement in the office, I finally called 20 mins or so after my appointment was supposed to start. After two awkward holds I was asked to reschedule. Didn’t reschedule. They had three clocks in the office, two set to different times and the one in the waiting room was stopped, ironic?",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

We're following recommendations from the ADA and CDC for the use of increased Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has significantly increased the cost to provide care, as the PPE we're wearing now is much more robust and advanced than before. We'd like to speak with you offline to address your concerns in a more personal manner. Please email us at feedback@dentalassociates.com and we'll put you in touch with our clinic manager.

         "My significant other had to have an extraction, crown removal and eventual implant.  The initial visits were very informative and the referral to the endodontist was very professional.  When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

It is not worth your time or the hassle you will probably be dealing with months later.\nI brought my daughter in for her first check up. I paid at the time of service in full, out of pocket-no insurance. 3.5 months later I get a bill saying I owe more money. I called and it took a lot of back and forth phone tag for someone to finally figure out what I was being charged for. I was being charged for THEIR MISTAKE!!! They said, oops we charged you as a return patient instead of a new patient so you owe us the difference that these visits cost.\nThey should have had better customer service and just eaten the cost. It wasn’t even that much. But it’s a matter of principle. Looks like they make these kinds of mistakes very frequently, charging others hundreds of extra dollars and expecting their patients to pay for the billing department’s mistakes. Oh, and then when you try and get it resolved, they will lie to you saying that the person in charge will call you but they won’t. They will write a cowardly email instead saying that you still owe them money and if you don’t pay it then interest will also be tacked on.\nIf you want to avoid dealing with liars and thieves, stay away from this office.\nThey will also write a robot response to this review saying they want to make things better and to contact them.

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

Dr. Larson feels like a family friend who is always fun to go visit and we get our teeth taken care of at the same time. We highly recommend Larson Dental!",

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

Also if this was a review of just their customer service I would give one star. Now it's my birthday and I am on my period because I can't get my prescription any longer. Worst customer support/service ever. Hopefully, I will be able to find a new company that can find a nice balance between customer service and production.",

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",

When it came to the actual extraction, crown removal and placement of a temporary crown, the experience turned into a nightmare.  Dr. Nolet struggled with the procedure, which took almost 3 hours.  Her and her assistant said they were using every tool they had, often dropping items, and looking for other tools to complete the very forceful extraction.  Bone grafting material was used, the site sutured and a temporary crown placed.  We left the office confidently, only to have to rush back in less than an hour, because the crown spontaneously fell off.  We caught Dr. Nolet as she was running out to her car to leave for the day.  She went back and in placed the crown again.  2 days later, it spontaneously fell off again.  When we called for an urgent appointment, we were told she was busy and that she leaves at 4 pm.  We came to find out that this practice, although listed as open till 7 pm, had only 1 dentist available some days, and only till 4 pm.  The owner, a very nice dentist, has his main practice in Carroll County and is also only there part time.  They seem to have only part time staff and their last dentist left a few months ago.  We showed up at the office, since they made no effort to give us an appointment or to consider this an urgent issue.  They later \"sanitized\" the temporary crown that had fallen on the floor, put it back in and told us that we can buy dental glue at CVS or use a combination of Vaseline and flour for the next time it falls off.  Then the doctor implied that the cause of the crown falling off was the fault of the patient and then complained about having to stay later thank 4 pm to take care of us.  Scary, most unprofessional, with questionable proficiency or quality of care, and certainly NOT customer oriented.",

My kids love going to his office because the hygienists know how to set them at ease (and they get to pick a treasure out of the treasure box when they are done.) Dr. Larson feels like a family friend who is always fun to go visit and we get our teeth taken care of at the same time. We highly recommend Larson Dental!",

I hope that if you see Dr. Lundstrom, you have a good experience.  If you don't, you might see a different side to him than what you hear about in the glowing reviews.  Dr. Lundstrom did an adjustment on me that resulted in me having to go to the Emergency Room.  In fact, after calling him back after the adjustment, he told that I needed to go the Emergency Room if my symptoms got worse.  Waking up in the middle of the night with your face going numb is a little scary...  This adjustment has cost me thousands of dollars and I am, over 1 month later, still not back to normal.  I have had to have a CT scan, MRI and to see a spine specialist because of it.  My arm continues to go numb because of it.  Not only have I not even received an apology from this man, he wrote me that “further communication with me would not be useful.”  What a great way to treat a patient...  This doctor is far from professional and cannot admit or take responsibility for his actions.  I would not recommend seeing him.  And please be aware that he informed me that he does not have insurance...that is a little concerning.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has been almost a year since this happened.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find relief for pain that was caused by this adjustment.  I now have to have surgery to fix the damaged caused by this provider.  Please be aware that when seeing this provider to relieve pain, it can actually result in much more pain and surgery on top of that to fix it.",

There is not a lot of communication if you need it and they changed my prescription to a different brand without telling me after about 4-5 months. Also if this was a review of just their customer service I would give one star. Now it's my birthday and I am on my period because I can't get my prescription any longer. Worst customer support/service ever. Hopefully, I will be able to find a new company that can find a nice balance between customer service and production.",

         "One of the worst, wasted trips if my life!! Mother of 4 kids, the youngest using a Bumbo seat until I found out they were recalled twice!!! Website told me to take back to the retailer I bought it from and get my refund. Well ya know how Walmart is any way (if you have my kind of luck) so I called them to make sure. I was transferred to the customer service desk and put on hold for 31 minutes and 31 seconds before I hung up and called again just to be put on hold for 10 more minutes!! Finally someone picks up, I told them the situation and was told \"yes, come and get your refund\". I then told her that I live 30 minutes away and only have enough gas to make it there and will have four kids and a stressed out husband at home waiting on me, and ask if I needed to bring just the seat or will I need proof of purchase because it was a gift and I didn't have proof. She assured me that all I had to bring was the seat. So I get there and tell them who I was and what I was returning for a recall and they immediately got an attitude and I explained what the lady on the phone said this employee walks away without saying anything and then comes back with another lady who tells me that she was the one who I talked to. Okay so I'm thinking we have got this handled now. Ohhh NOOO, was I ever wrong!! By the end of the 2 and half hour argument and explaining over and over again while in disbelief the whole time because of how I'm being treated! Now all the sudden this employee whom I discussed this with on the phone who assured me I would have the gas money to get back home to my babies has changed her mind and now needs the original package the seat came in. Well IDK about anyone else but I don't have the space or patience to save the boxes from every item I and/or someone buys for me and my family!! They went as far as to turn their name tags around where you can't see their names and even scraped off the 1800# to corporate off the designated sign for these types of incidents!! All they could tell me was that I had to call another 1800# to get a belt kit sent in the mail to me so that I can punctured holes in this seat for the belt straps to be inserted. Ya like that would have help all the 19 babies who have suffered skull fractures, bleeding of the brain, and even collapsed arteries from falling out of this seat!!! No refund after 2and half hours of being humiliated and disrespected in front of everyone. Thank the Lord my mother and step dad were there to help me out of a bad situation I was delibertly put in by employees who had absolutely no respect for the situation they put me in!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER THINK OF GOING TO THIS WALMART EVER AGAIN!! Save yourself the headache and trouble of spending your money in this establishment. I have never been so humiliated and disrespected in my life! This place is disgusting to the core!!",
