         "I have suffered from chronic pain for nearly a decade now. The pain began after I had my first child, and over the years, as well as after subsequent children, new areas of pain began to surface. I have been to every traditional doctor you can imagine, my PCP, pain specialists, and even physical therapists. Despite the many x-rays, MRI's, and all of the blood work, perscription pain killers and pain injections, my pain never was relieved and no source of pain could be identified. My PCP began telling me that my pain was simply psycho-semantic.\n\nBut clearly my pain was coming from somewhere, my shoulders pop and grind as they move, loud enough for others to look at me wildly and wonder if I am alright; my hips and knees do the same. I even went to other chiropractors to try and find some relief. While I did find some very temporary relief from treatments from the other chiropractors, nothing was long lasting and eventually I wanted to find the real source of pain. No matter what kind of testing was done, no one could find why I was in so much pain.\n\nFinally, I gave up and figured I would just learn to live with my pain, after all maybe it really was psycho-semantic! Then, I became pregnant with my fourth baby, and the pain became unbearable. I would wake up in the morning and my hands would be so numb that I would have to run hot water over them just to get any sensation back, my grip started to go, and I had no idea what to do. That's when I found Dr. Myshka.\n\nIn just three adjustments, my pregnancy related carpel tunnel was gone. My headaches disappeared, and I found energy I haven't had in years. The reason Dr. Myshka works when other chiropractors didn't is because he uses the Gonstead system, and he has 30+ years of experience.\n\nI knew after my first consultation that Dr. Myshka was different than any other chiropractor I have ever seen. His tools are different, his methods are different, and his naked eye spotted every single thing that other doctors told me were wrong through x-ray testing and MRI's without me saying a word to him about it, and then he also found more.\n\nNot only did Dr. Myshka spot everything structurally wrong with my spine, but he noticed vitamin deficiencies, recommended new sleeping positions, and every little bit of information he has given me has made a huge difference in the quality of my daily life. I was resigned to the fact that I would suffer from pain for the rest of my life, but in less than a week, Dr. Myshka has proven to me that with regular adjustments, good vitamins, good food, and changes to my posture, I can minimize my pain and prevent any further injuries.\n\nI was praying for a doctor that would see me as a whole human being, and not just another source of income. Dr. Myshka is the answer to my prayers, and I am so thankful that we have him in the N.W.A. area! Thanks Doctor, and please don't ever leave!",

Two had no masks at all and one was wearing the mask around their chin. And of the two people wearing masks, one was wearing a mask that has a respirator on it which we all know is extremely dangerous for other people as it still releases germs (virus) back into the air. This person was at the front desk which means they didn't have 6 ft social distance from customers when ringing up orders. Not great...\n\nI can't recommend this as a place to visit during covid-19 if you are vulnerable. In general, if a person doesn't need to be in there long and isn't worried then go for it but if you need to be careful I'd say choose somewhere else.\n\nIf I could I would give Rock Canyon a 4.5. They are always friendly and good to work with. Some of the people at the front desk have proven very helpful in trying to find coupons and dealing with insurance. However, it can be really slow even if you call in. They often don't have what we need in stock. These are minor complaints and overall a great place.",

         "Staff and optometrist are all very nice and friendly. Office is nice, good parking. Nice selection of frames. I’m giving this business five stars because they delivered everything you’d need and want, and created a very nice experience.\n\nIt would be unfair to rate them less because of my own personal preferences. But I’m sorry to say, for me, there were some huge opportunities for improvement.\n\n1. Severe over explaining! Really, there was SO SO SO SO much talking. I listened to the assistant explain everything in triplicate. Then the optometrist came in and re-explained everything in triplicate. Please, explain something, ask the patient if they have questions, and move on. Many patients have probably had countless eye exams before and while some may need more explanation, others may not. I appreciate the customer service, but wow, it was overkill.\n\n2. When the time came to go pick frames, I didn’t like being followed all over by the frame sales lady. I felt hurried and pressured. Again, some patients may want that assistance. Others have been frame shopping every year for 20 years. I know what I like and what I want. Leave me be for five minutes, seriously.\n\n3. After frames were picked, and calculations made, the frame sales lady complied my order with the MOST expensive offerings possible, and presented it as final. “Ok, so with frames, the BMW lenses with solid gold coating, diamond crusting, and protective unicorn horn treatment, your total is $12,724,885.00. Do you want to put that on a visa?” UGH!!! I hate that. It traps unknowing patients into just accepting what they are offered. Then, when I asked about more affordable options, I felt like I was treated a little more curtly. Not impolitely, it was just something I felt and I might be wrong. I’ve never experience sales tactics like that at a medical professionals office. It made me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, yeah. I still recommend this office. I would go again for my next exam, but I also might try another optometrist. Just because I feel like I’d need to mentally prepare for another visit to this office, and I’d rather be comfortable and relaxed when spending hundreds of dollars.",

I would have been satisfied and felt much better just being genuinely listened to as she did, but to top it off the lady offered me a full refund.\n\nI truly appreciate that the Banfield company took the time to reach out and go above and beyond to rectify as much as they could.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHE WORST STAFF EVER. I had to bring my family dog in with my Mom to be euthanized here and we had the absolute worst experience. I explicitly told the staff many times that I would deal with payment and deciding what to do with his remains multiple times (so that my Mom wouldn't have to rehash the specifics of everything as this was very hard for her), and so... many.... times... they asked me, my brother and mother literally multiple times the same question. On top of that they overcharged me for the procedure by over $100 and have been terrible to deal with in getting the refund. This place may be ok while your animal is alive and well, but HORRIBLE to deal with for delicate situations. I highly do not recommend as the staff do not seem to listen to or understand the people of the pets they see.",

I would have liked to have contacted you directly but you did not leave an email address and the phone number you put down on the guest courtesy card is not your number( the woman who answered the phone had no idea who you were).\n\nYour 'simple' questions were actually not simple at all. You used industry terminology and asked questions that an average prospect walking into our gym for the first time would have never asked. I will say the blazing red flag was when you inquired about our daycare rates, yet by your own admission neither you or your friend have children. Why would our daycare rates be relevant to your situations-it really had nothing to do with your ethnicity or age, as you claimed.\n\nRegardless, I asked you in a very respectful and professional manner whether you and your friend were professional shoppers. I did explain that a competitor was opening up nearby  and we had been shopped by them in the past. It was a direct questions but  in no way rude or confrontational. But I will say your response was. You were very defensive and sarcastic and the way you both abruptly left the gym could very possibly confirm any suspicions.\n\nClearly you were agitated enough to write an angry review, and if I made an erroneous assumption I would like to make it right by offering  you and your friend a free month at our facility. Since you mentioned only being in the area temporarily, this would be ideal.  Please let us know when you plan to come in and I will leave the month pass for you at the front desk.",

In 2014, I finally had an X-ray done that showed quite a bit of compression on my spine. I made an appt with Dr. Zahir and another doctor at the time. Dr. Zahir gave me my options for fixing my problem, injections or surgery. He explained both options thoroughly. The other doctor gave me one option, an injection that he decided he would do on the spot, not even give me time to consider it. This didn’t sit well with me at all. I ended up going with the surgery option with Dr. Zahir. I was very nervous and probably asked more questions than anyone could imagine, but he was very understanding and always eager to answer every question with as much detail as possible. A few days before my surgery, I started having horrible sciatica pain, down my right leg. I lost feeling in my right shin. The surgery took away nearly all my pain, but I still have numbness in the right shin due to nerve damage that is irreversible. I can’t help but to think that this could have turned out way worse had I gone with the route that the other doctor was planning. Dr. Zahir is caring and understanding with any concerns that his patients have. This is my long way of saying, I will stick with Dr. Zahir no matter where he is. He has moved offices since I first saw him, about 1.5 hour drive away for me, but I will gladly make the drive to see him before I will go to any other doctor in my area.",

         "Our family is so pleased with the training our two mutts received at Premier Dog Training's two week boot camp.  It has been just over a week since we got our girls home from Premier and the difference in them is incredible.  I called Premier because the dogs were out of control and becoming increasingly reactive.  We had tried 3 different trainers.  While  our dogs learned some commands, they would only follow them if they were at home with no distractions.  We needed something a lot more intensive! When I called Premier, Rick called me right back.  He spent over 1/2 hour listening to what I had to say and asking questions.  Rick gave me hope that they could help, while also being very honest. When we decided to sign the dogs up, he spent an hour on the phone getting information.  The two biggest problems with our dogs was 1.increased reactivity on the leash with other dogs, and 2. the insane out of control scene when anyone rang the door bell and tried to enter our house.  Both dogs were terrible on the leash.  They pulled liked crazy, even with a prong collar.  When they would see another dog while on leash, they would go nuts jumping, pulling, barking, snarling, and growling, eventually started turning on each other..  After the two week bootcamp I can walk both dogs with no problems at all. They have both learned to walk in an \"easy\" manner with no pulling on the leash.  When we walk past another dog, they are reminded to \"leave it.\"  I just spent an hour with them at a local park with a walking trail. We went past 6 dogs and not once was there a scene.  I even had someone compliment me on how well behave they were!  Before Premier, it was very embarrassing to have people over.  If someone rang the door bell, they would bark like crazy and jump at the door and window.  Once I was able to get the person inside, the insanity continued. One dog would continuously jump on guests -- both their front and back- she even knocked people over!  The other dog would bark and growl.  This could go on for 15 to 20 minutes before they calmed down.  Now, after the boot camp, it is completely different.  When the door bell rings, I let the dogs have a little bark.  Then they are told, 'quiet', then 'sit' away from the door and 'wait'.  Once I open the door they are told to 'say hi' and are reminded to stay off.They get excited but in a normal dog wagging and sniffing kind of way.  All of this takes A LOT of reinforcement to the training they got at Premier.  When you pick the dogs up from boot camp, the human's get trained on how to properly keep up the work done by Premier.  You cannot expect your dog to get the training, come home and never have to work on training again.  Premier lays the groundwork, you have to continue it. If you are not consistent your dog will start to regress back to old habits.  Premier taught them what to do, it is up to me to make sure I convey that in the proper manner. I am still working on it!  Premier's facility is very nice -- they had just moved into the new place a week prior.  The trainers we met who had worked with our dogs were very caring and obviously love what they do.  Also Premier is great about posting videos and pictures of your dogs getting trained and having fun in the play yard on Instagram.  I emailed twice asking for updates on them and was given a prompt response.  Since my dogs have been home, I have emailed with Jes several times asking questions.  She was very prompt in responding back. Also you are entitled to a home visit afterwards if you are having problems with your dogs. We live an hour and a half away from Premier but they promised that if we need it they will come.  And they have invited me to come down to work with the dogs at their facility anytime I feel I need help with issues around other dogs.This is all free of charge.  If you board at the facility after the boot camp, they will give the dog one refresher training session each day! Bottom line -- no regrets to sending them to boot camp. Best decision we made for our family and for our beloved dogs.",

Despite the many x-rays, MRI's, and all of the blood work, perscription pain killers and pain injections, my pain never was relieved and no source of pain could be identified. My PCP began telling me that my pain was simply psycho-semantic.\n\nBut clearly my pain was coming from somewhere, my shoulders pop and grind as they move, loud enough for others to look at me wildly and wonder if I am alright; my hips and knees do the same. I even went to other chiropractors to try and find some relief. While I did find some very temporary relief from treatments from the other chiropractors, nothing was long lasting and eventually I wanted to find the real source of pain. No matter what kind of testing was done, no one could find why I was in so much pain.\n\nFinally, I gave up and figured I would just learn to live with my pain, after all maybe it really was psycho-semantic! Then, I became pregnant with my fourth baby, and the pain became unbearable. I would wake up in the morning and my hands would be so numb that I would have to run hot water over them just to get any sensation back, my grip started to go, and I had no idea what to do. That's when I found Dr. Myshka.\n\nIn just three adjustments, my pregnancy related carpel tunnel was gone. My headaches disappeared, and I found energy I haven't had in years. The reason Dr. Myshka works when other chiropractors didn't is because he uses the Gonstead system, and he has 30+ years of experience.\n\nI knew after my first consultation that Dr. Myshka was different than any other chiropractor I have ever seen. His tools are different, his methods are different, and his naked eye spotted every single thing that other doctors told me were wrong through x-ray testing and MRI's without me saying a word to him about it, and then he also found more.\n\nNot only did Dr. Myshka spot everything structurally wrong with my spine, but he noticed vitamin deficiencies, recommended new sleeping positions, and every little bit of information he has given me has made a huge difference in the quality of my daily life. I was resigned to the fact that I would suffer from pain for the rest of my life, but in less than a week, Dr. Myshka has proven to me that with regular adjustments, good vitamins, good food, and changes to my posture, I can minimize my pain and prevent any further injuries.\n\nI was praying for a doctor that would see me as a whole human being, and not just another source of income. Dr. Myshka is the answer to my prayers, and I am so thankful that we have him in the N.W.A. area! Thanks Doctor, and please don't ever leave!",

         "COVID-19 Update:\nI really like Rock Canyon but this is just information for anyone who is vulnerable and needs to be very cautious. (First problem) This pharmacy did not require masks ever. When Provo mandated masks they started to require them but probably won't require them in the future when the mandate goes away. (Second problem) They don't actually wear their masks or take it seriously. Last time in was in there were 5 people working there. Only two of the 5 people were wearing masks. Two had no masks at all and one was wearing the mask around their chin. And of the two people wearing masks, one was wearing a mask that has a respirator on it which we all know is extremely dangerous for other people as it still releases germs (virus) back into the air. This person was at the front desk which means they didn't have 6 ft social distance from customers when ringing up orders. Not great...\n\nI can't recommend this as a place to visit during covid-19 if you are vulnerable. In general, if a person doesn't need to be in there long and isn't worried then go for it but if you need to be careful I'd say choose somewhere else.\n\nIf I could I would give Rock Canyon a 4.5. They are always friendly and good to work with. Some of the people at the front desk have proven very helpful in trying to find coupons and dealing with insurance. However, it can be really slow even if you call in. They often don't have what we need in stock. These are minor complaints and overall a great place.",

         "Staff and optometrist are all very nice and friendly. Office is nice, good parking. Nice selection of frames. I’m giving this business five stars because they delivered everything you’d need and want, and created a very nice experience.\n\nIt would be unfair to rate them less because of my own personal preferences. But I’m sorry to say, for me, there were some huge opportunities for improvement.\n\n1. Severe over explaining! Really, there was SO SO SO SO much talking. I listened to the assistant explain everything in triplicate. Then the optometrist came in and re-explained everything in triplicate. Please, explain something, ask the patient if they have questions, and move on. Many patients have probably had countless eye exams before and while some may need more explanation, others may not. I appreciate the customer service, but wow, it was overkill.\n\n2. When the time came to go pick frames, I didn’t like being followed all over by the frame sales lady. I felt hurried and pressured. Again, some patients may want that assistance. Others have been frame shopping every year for 20 years. I know what I like and what I want. Leave me be for five minutes, seriously.\n\n3. After frames were picked, and calculations made, the frame sales lady complied my order with the MOST expensive offerings possible, and presented it as final. “Ok, so with frames, the BMW lenses with solid gold coating, diamond crusting, and protective unicorn horn treatment, your total is $12,724,885.00. Do you want to put that on a visa?” UGH!!! I hate that. It traps unknowing patients into just accepting what they are offered. Then, when I asked about more affordable options, I felt like I was treated a little more curtly. Not impolitely, it was just something I felt and I might be wrong. I’ve never experience sales tactics like that at a medical professionals office. It made me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, yeah. I still recommend this office. I would go again for my next exam, but I also might try another optometrist. Just because I feel like I’d need to mentally prepare for another visit to this office, and I’d rather be comfortable and relaxed when spending hundreds of dollars.",

         "I've always hated the dentist, embarrassed from being an 80's child who parents didn't push dental hygiene. They are so welcoming. Fast forward I have a chronic illness called Gastroparies and gastric dysmotiliy disorder. My entire GI system is paralyzed. It  has left me with severe malnutrition. I am on tube feeding at age 37. Before this I was a fitness trainer. My illness has ruined my teeth even more. 2 of my front teeth literally broke off due to the malnutrition. My husband is a registered nurse he went to my consult appointment with me. My husband was blown away by the Dentist's actions, caring, and more. From a nurse/ Dr stand point he was extremely impressed. I'm a very strong person dealing with my illness I fight every day, but dealing with my teeth has knocked me down emotionally. I stay so strong dealing with my illness that I have no energy left for fighting my dental issues. Smith & Elliot have taken my problem with my teeth I feel like I don't have to worry about my dental issues it will be taken care of by them. I highly recommend this dental practice. I was referred years ago by a friend who hated dentist, had horrible experiences in past. But loved this practice.",

         "I have suffered from chronic pain for nearly a decade now. The pain began after I had my first child, and over the years, as well as after subsequent children, new areas of pain began to surface. I have been to every traditional doctor you can imagine, my PCP, pain specialists, and even physical therapists. Despite the many x-rays, MRI's, and all of the blood work, perscription pain killers and pain injections, my pain never was relieved and no source of pain could be identified. My PCP began telling me that my pain was simply psycho-semantic.\n\nBut clearly my pain was coming from somewhere, my shoulders pop and grind as they move, loud enough for others to look at me wildly and wonder if I am alright; my hips and knees do the same. I even went to other chiropractors to try and find some relief. While I did find some very temporary relief from treatments from the other chiropractors, nothing was long lasting and eventually I wanted to find the real source of pain. No matter what kind of testing was done, no one could find why I was in so much pain.\n\nFinally, I gave up and figured I would just learn to live with my pain, after all maybe it really was psycho-semantic! Then, I became pregnant with my fourth baby, and the pain became unbearable. I would wake up in the morning and my hands would be so numb that I would have to run hot water over them just to get any sensation back, my grip started to go, and I had no idea what to do. That's when I found Dr. Myshka.\n\nIn just three adjustments, my pregnancy related carpel tunnel was gone. My headaches disappeared, and I found energy I haven't had in years. The reason Dr. Myshka works when other chiropractors didn't is because he uses the Gonstead system, and he has 30+ years of experience.\n\nI knew after my first consultation that Dr. Myshka was different than any other chiropractor I have ever seen. His tools are different, his methods are different, and his naked eye spotted every single thing that other doctors told me were wrong through x-ray testing and MRI's without me saying a word to him about it, and then he also found more.\n\nNot only did Dr. Myshka spot everything structurally wrong with my spine, but he noticed vitamin deficiencies, recommended new sleeping positions, and every little bit of information he has given me has made a huge difference in the quality of my daily life. I was resigned to the fact that I would suffer from pain for the rest of my life, but in less than a week, Dr. Myshka has proven to me that with regular adjustments, good vitamins, good food, and changes to my posture, I can minimize my pain and prevent any further injuries.\n\nI was praying for a doctor that would see me as a whole human being, and not just another source of income. Dr. Myshka is the answer to my prayers, and I am so thankful that we have him in the N.W.A. area! Thanks Doctor, and please don't ever leave!",

         "COVID-19 Update:\nI really like Rock Canyon but this is just information for anyone who is vulnerable and needs to be very cautious. (First problem) This pharmacy did not require masks ever. When Provo mandated masks they started to require them but probably won't require them in the future when the mandate goes away. (Second problem) They don't actually wear their masks or take it seriously. Last time in was in there were 5 people working there. Only two of the 5 people were wearing masks. Two had no masks at all and one was wearing the mask around their chin. And of the two people wearing masks, one was wearing a mask that has a respirator on it which we all know is extremely dangerous for other people as it still releases germs (virus) back into the air. This person was at the front desk which means they didn't have 6 ft social distance from customers when ringing up orders. Not great...\n\nI can't recommend this as a place to visit during covid-19 if you are vulnerable. In general, if a person doesn't need to be in there long and isn't worried then go for it but if you need to be careful I'd say choose somewhere else.\n\nIf I could I would give Rock Canyon a 4.5. They are always friendly and good to work with. Some of the people at the front desk have proven very helpful in trying to find coupons and dealing with insurance. However, it can be really slow even if you call in. They often don't have what we need in stock. These are minor complaints and overall a great place.",

I’m giving this business five stars because they delivered everything you’d need and want, and created a very nice experience.\n\nIt would be unfair to rate them less because of my own personal preferences. But I’m sorry to say, for me, there were some huge opportunities for improvement.\n\n1. Severe over explaining! Really, there was SO SO SO SO much talking. I listened to the assistant explain everything in triplicate. Then the optometrist came in and re-explained everything in triplicate. Please, explain something, ask the patient if they have questions, and move on. Many patients have probably had countless eye exams before and while some may need more explanation, others may not. I appreciate the customer service, but wow, it was overkill.\n\n2. When the time came to go pick frames, I didn’t like being followed all over by the frame sales lady. I felt hurried and pressured. Again, some patients may want that assistance. Others have been frame shopping every year for 20 years. I know what I like and what I want. Leave me be for five minutes, seriously.\n\n3. After frames were picked, and calculations made, the frame sales lady complied my order with the MOST expensive offerings possible, and presented it as final. “Ok, so with frames, the BMW lenses with solid gold coating, diamond crusting, and protective unicorn horn treatment, your total is $12,724,885.00. Do you want to put that on a visa?” UGH!!! I hate that. It traps unknowing patients into just accepting what they are offered. Then, when I asked about more affordable options, I felt like I was treated a little more curtly. Not impolitely, it was just something I felt and I might be wrong. I’ve never experience sales tactics like that at a medical professionals office. It made me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, yeah. I still recommend this office. I would go again for my next exam, but I also might try another optometrist. Just because I feel like I’d need to mentally prepare for another visit to this office, and I’d rather be comfortable and relaxed when spending hundreds of dollars.",

Before this I was a fitness trainer. My illness has ruined my teeth even more. 2 of my front teeth literally broke off due to the malnutrition. My husband is a registered nurse he went to my consult appointment with me. My husband was blown away by the Dentist's actions, caring, and more. From a nurse/ Dr stand point he was extremely impressed. I'm a very strong person dealing with my illness I fight every day, but dealing with my teeth has knocked me down emotionally. I stay so strong dealing with my illness that I have no energy left for fighting my dental issues. Smith & Elliot have taken my problem with my teeth I feel like I don't have to worry about my dental issues it will be taken care of by them. I highly recommend this dental practice.

         "Staff and optometrist are all very nice and friendly. Office is nice, good parking. Nice selection of frames. I’m giving this business five stars because they delivered everything you’d need and want, and created a very nice experience.\n\nIt would be unfair to rate them less because of my own personal preferences. But I’m sorry to say, for me, there were some huge opportunities for improvement.\n\n1. Severe over explaining! Really, there was SO SO SO SO much talking. I listened to the assistant explain everything in triplicate. Then the optometrist came in and re-explained everything in triplicate. Please, explain something, ask the patient if they have questions, and move on. Many patients have probably had countless eye exams before and while some may need more explanation, others may not. I appreciate the customer service, but wow, it was overkill.\n\n2. When the time came to go pick frames, I didn’t like being followed all over by the frame sales lady. I felt hurried and pressured. Again, some patients may want that assistance. Others have been frame shopping every year for 20 years. I know what I like and what I want. Leave me be for five minutes, seriously.\n\n3. After frames were picked, and calculations made, the frame sales lady complied my order with the MOST expensive offerings possible, and presented it as final. “Ok, so with frames, the BMW lenses with solid gold coating, diamond crusting, and protective unicorn horn treatment, your total is $12,724,885.00. Do you want to put that on a visa?” UGH!!! I hate that. It traps unknowing patients into just accepting what they are offered. Then, when I asked about more affordable options, I felt like I was treated a little more curtly. Not impolitely, it was just something I felt and I might be wrong. I’ve never experience sales tactics like that at a medical professionals office. It made me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, yeah. I still recommend this office. I would go again for my next exam, but I also might try another optometrist. Just because I feel like I’d need to mentally prepare for another visit to this office, and I’d rather be comfortable and relaxed when spending hundreds of dollars.",

         "***Update***\nThe office called me literally same day I wrote this and apologized and explained I was quoted the amount for a new surgery.  Redeemed!\n\nI had my lasik performed here 8 years ago.  About 4 or 5 years ago my vision started to regress.  I do not fault them for that.  My first round experience was great.\n\nFast forward to 8 months ago, I called them to see if they might do an adjustment.  Since then I moved to Seattle and had to schedule time off of work to visit for an exam.  At that time I received a strange attitude from the doctor about my visions changes.  He told me to wait another 6 months to see if anything changes.  I was pretty annoyed as I felt I was being swept under the rug.  After 6 months I called to let them know nothing had changed and I wanted to move forward with it.   A woman answered the phone and said she had to check on some things and would call me back.  No call back.  She also told me the cost of the adjustment would be free or very little.  I finally called them back and got another woman who happily scheduled my appointment for about 2 months out from then.  It was understood that I was from out of town and the surgery would be tentative based on an exam that same day.  I was told someone would contact me prior with instructions, and she told me very little at the time.\n\nTwo days before my scheduled surgery (again had to schedule time off work) I called them as I had not heard from them at all.  After being placed on hold the woman on the phone admitted my appointment had been lost, but they'd get me in anyway. Great.  I told her I needed instructions and had questions.  I was given really vague info.  She called me back not long after to inform me she believed I would need a different kind of surgery since it had been so long since the initial and would call me back the next day after talking with the doctor.  She did call me today to confirm what the doctor said and agreed to the new surgery.  OK, but what is the cost to me?  $4500!\n\nAfter being swept under the rug, pushed off, not called back, losing my appointment, failing to give me adequate information for planning travel and time off of work - NO WAY! I have lost my confidence in this place, staff and doc included, and would rather give my money to someone else.  Thank you for wasting my time!!!",

I’m giving this business five stars because they delivered everything you’d need and want, and created a very nice experience.\n\nIt would be unfair to rate them less because of my own personal preferences. But I’m sorry to say, for me, there were some huge opportunities for improvement.\n\n1. Severe over explaining! Really, there was SO SO SO SO much talking. I listened to the assistant explain everything in triplicate. Then the optometrist came in and re-explained everything in triplicate. Please, explain something, ask the patient if they have questions, and move on. Many patients have probably had countless eye exams before and while some may need more explanation, others may not. I appreciate the customer service, but wow, it was overkill.\n\n2. When the time came to go pick frames, I didn’t like being followed all over by the frame sales lady. I felt hurried and pressured. Again, some patients may want that assistance. Others have been frame shopping every year for 20 years. I know what I like and what I want. Leave me be for five minutes, seriously.\n\n3. After frames were picked, and calculations made, the frame sales lady complied my order with the MOST expensive offerings possible, and presented it as final. “Ok, so with frames, the BMW lenses with solid gold coating, diamond crusting, and protective unicorn horn treatment, your total is $12,724,885.00. Do you want to put that on a visa?” UGH!!! I hate that. It traps unknowing patients into just accepting what they are offered. Then, when I asked about more affordable options, I felt like I was treated a little more curtly. Not impolitely, it was just something I felt and I might be wrong. I’ve never experience sales tactics like that at a medical professionals office. It made me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, yeah. I still recommend this office. I would go again for my next exam, but I also might try another optometrist. Just because I feel like I’d need to mentally prepare for another visit to this office, and I’d rather be comfortable and relaxed when spending hundreds of dollars.",

She let me know that she could assign someone else for me. I decided to give it another chance. The next time was a complete turn around. We were help by Liz and she was amazing with my son.

I am, however, offended by current office procedures. Prior to a recent visit, I received a postcard, a home phone call, an e-mail, and two texts reminding me of my upcoming appointment. Furthermore, all of these indicated an appointment time that was 15 minutes earlier than the appointment card I was given when I'd made the appointment six months earlier. I find this much oversight to be excessive and intrusive. Furthermore, falsifying my appointment time to ensure I'd be early is just plain insulting.",

Everyone was kind, gentle, and patient as they walked me through the entire process from beginning to end. My visit went past closing time and at no point did anyone try and rush me out the door. I have never had a cavity and have always tried to take care of my teeth, but no matter how much I clean my teeth I have always left my previous dentists feeling belittled, judged and like I needed to floss for the next 5 years non stop. Not once did I feel this way here. Do I love going to the dentist? No, but do I love this place already? Yes!\nCome see for yourself. You won’t be disappointed!",

One doctor on base once told me he couldn't figure out what was wrong with me so I must just have mental problems 😡 (It turned out to be my gallbladder and Jody was the one who figured that out). I have been dismissed and talked over and treated like my concerns didn't matter.  Jody is literally the only health care provider that I have ever met who has been willing to listen and to investigate.

         "I have been going to this CVS location for almost a year now. They have always treated me with respect and I always try to be respectful and considerate. That's one of the many rules of life. I realize that I am not their only customer and any reasonable person who has ever worked with the public can say the same thing about the reviews and comments of customers and their poor attitudes. If for some reason you have to wait a few more minutes, so what. Some people are oblivious to the fact that just bc you might be the only customer in the store doesn't mean that they have nothing to attend to. Look around and tell me what you see behind the counter. Thousands of prescriptions that they are responsible for. I agree with making sure you get the right prescription bc that is definitely a huge ordeal, life or death as one review I read. Although, you brought in the prescription to them and you know what your doctor is writing you. I think it is also your responsibility to ensure that you are getting what your doctor prescribed. Situational awareness 101- They deal with 1000's of prescriptions a day and mistakes can happen and anything that can happen inevitably will happen.  There are so many factors that can cause a mistake when your pharmacy is not the only one who you go through to get your script. Any methodical and intellectual person will know that you have a description on the bottle; the shape, color, and what it should say. We've all made mistakes, some worse than others but a mistake can be avoided if you have any sense of awareness......\nI also saw a review how rude and disrespectful the automated message that's sent via text or email. Lol It's not intended to be anything more than giving you, the recipient, a simple and effective way to tell you that your prescription is ready for pick up. I mean if that isn't the most ridiculous thing to complain about please let me know so I can make sure I am not losing my mind. Come on that's got to be worst complaint I can even fathom.           \"CVS Pharmacy: (Name), your Rx is ready for pickup.\" They give you an option to have a msg sent out to tell you your script is available so you can do other things instead of crossing your arms, huffing and puffing while rolling your eyes. Its made for your convenience basically to get you in and out without a wait. I don't know why I am amazed. Some people have no clue and think their in a bubble and I see it on a regular occurrence. We are so worried about anything that may seem like an inconvenience when that is such petty and childish behavior. That's why we can't even stand together as a nation bc some people live off others faults and misery. Thank you to all the hard work you guys do for me to keep me from being sick, in pain, anxiety, etc. That's what should be said in these reviews. You guys rock! Thanks CVS Store #4111",

         "Let me start off by saying I hate going to the dentist. It is soley because of this fact I felt I had to write this review for anyone out there new to the area or who hasn’t had work done recently. If you cannot ignore the problem any longer, have a medical emergency, or anything in between look no further. This is the place you want to go. I had a dental emergency involving a moderately complex procedure. Without getting into to much detail, the roots inside two veneers at the front of my mouth snapped due to a heavy impact at my workplace. Previously I had both a root canal and an ipecoectomey done by an oral surgeon. Having almost no actual bone left a graft was required so implant posts could be attached at a later date. Throughout the course of my treatment at Pan Dental I saw all three Dr. Pans and each one showed an expertise that was unparalleled. Not only did they managed to see me not but two hours after the initial incident, but they gave me a full X-Ray and formulated an entire written care plan which they then forwarded to my workmen’s comp claim that same day. The receptionist is charming and presents a carefree attitude all the while working seemlessly with the Pans to make the entire procedure as easy on the patient as possible. Further making the whole experience painless in more ways then one. She contacted my employer directly and made it so I didn’t have to shuffle through mountains of paperwork as would usually be the norm for such a case. Not so at Pan Dental. They managed to begin the aforementioned process of grafting bone into my gums the very next day. Thus beggining a six months long process of implanting new titanium posts into the newly minted jaw bone. This procedure was hell and all three Doctor Pans kept me comfortable before, after, and during the procedure without ever over medicating. Thier maticulous skill being the first and foremost tool of pain management used so that aftercare didn’t drag on and put me the patient at risk. Again I hate the dentist with a passion. But for the record Mr. And Mrs Pan should be proud for not only having started a truely successful family business in the age of disconnected corporate medicine; but also for raising thier extremely knowledgeable kind son (and daughter!) who can carry on the family’s legacy. You as a patient of the Pans can rest assured that long after thier tenure within the dental community has ended the quality, compassion, and expertise I experienced during this hard time will be carried on for another generation. For that I would just like to say thank you. It is one thing to be a master of your craft it is another thing entirely to master being a decent human being.",

         "I really like Dr. Williams, and I generally find Doctors frustrating.  She brings curiosity and compassion to her work, when so many Doctors ask questions they think they know the answers to and then don't listen when you tell them what's going on.  I know I'm not a medical professional, and I know that Dr. Facebook has some really crazy ideas about sound medical practice, but I *am* the expert on being inside this body they are supposed to be helping me take care of, and she treats me like I might actually have some useful information about what's going on with my body.  Sad that this is a rare trait in a doctor, but Dr. Williams has it.\n\nIn my first visit, Dr. Williams also asked about my experience with her staff - the long wait times on the phone, difficulty getting through, and other customer service hiccups are a known challenge for the practice and she expressed her commitment to improving this aspect of the patient experience.  Frankly, I'll wait on the phone for as long as I have to for a doctor that respects me, but others might not make the same choice.\n\neta: the customer service really is awful.  It is really difficult to get someone on the phone, you don't get call backs, they put you on hold with no acknowledgement.  I'm not sure what it is going to take to get this aspect of the practice on track, but it hasn't improved appreciably.",

         "I will have to come back and write another review later with more details on physical improvement and other evidence of healing I'm sure, however I am so overwhelmed with gratitude and amazement after my first visit today that I had to go ahead and write something!  I admit to shedding tears on my way to the Theta Wellness Center earlier today because I knew if this didn't work, I had nothing left in me to try anything else.  I have been on a journey of seeking health for years, probably since childhood to be honest.  I can't remember a time that I didn't have chronic fatigue and have only worsened through the years and developed many other symptoms like chronic joint pain, migraines, insomnia, and in more recent years anxiety and debilitating fear.  I have made my life's work revolve around my quest for relief and improvement in my own health, choosing a career in natural and alternative healing.  Despite loving to learn about natural healing modalities and constantly researching and trying everything from the most traditional to the most obscure healing practices, I always seemed to hit a wall in what little improvements I experienced.  And to make matters worse after hitting that wall I always seemed to regress backward further than where I had started.  This was compounded by several experiences of extreme heartbreak, loss and trauma through the last few years and I eventually found myself debilitated by fear.  I was afraid to try anything more for fear of making things worse, and yet afraid to relax and stop jumping through all the physical hoops I had collected along the way (nutrition, detox programs, obsessively researching looking for \"the answer\", etc) because I already felt so rotten that I thought I couldn't get away without it.  I couldn't tell anymore what was helping and what was hurting and my mind and body were so exhausted and in so much pain that I had to withdraw from my career so I knew I couldn't keep up physically or financially anymore.  This is when I finally started to realize that there must be something deeper going on than me just needing the right physical solution.  I started to understand that I must have some inner emotional block to healing.  It was so frustrating hearing from doctors or just healthy friends that I just needed to try harder or be more disciplined.  I was disciplining myself to death!   It was truly in the nic of time that I found the Theta Wellness Center and although I attended my first class with apprehension and a fear of getting my hopes up and being disappointed, I left that night after class feeling profoundly sure that I was in the right place.  There is something truly different about Mike.  Remember this is coming from a holistic healthcare practitioner myself, so I am used to interacting with many different kinds of healers and practitioners, most of which do have a desire to help people. But the genuine-ness I sensed from Mike from that first class deeply moved me.  I didn't just feel like I'd found a \"good doctor\".  I deeply sensed both his desire and profound skill for helping people get to their core issues in a loving and safe environment to facilitate true healing.  He shows respect and understanding for my spiritual beliefs and, especially after my first consultation and treatment today, I feel confident that we will be able to move forward in helping me heal spiritual and emotional deep wounds that have been preventing me from healing physically.  I am still in awe at the bliss and profound confidence I felt today even while addressing painful wounds that my subconscious had built seemingly impenetrable walls around.  I had been afraid going in today of what \"traumas\" or repressed memories I might have to face, however I can tell you that even with some emotions being released, it was all a very pleasant and safe feeling experience.  And I finally get what so many people have described in feeling as if a burden is lifted.  I look forward to adding to this review later after seeing how things change in my life as a result.  I am so grateful already!",

         "The hospital is doing the best it can with the lack of healthcare providers for all hospitals in the US in general. The medical center does it's best to recruit doctors and the people of Klamath are very ungrateful for the hospital we do have. I'm guessing that most people here do not understand how long the waits are in Portland or other areas. Just because Portland is larger, doesn't mean they don't have many hospitals that are terrible. Sky Lakes gives much back to the community and is one of the last community (locally) owned hospitals in the state. If you think another entity taking over is a good thing, then you are very mistaken.\n\nThe hospital is used to drug seekers coming to the ER and trying to coax doctors to give them controlled substances, it amazes me how the public cannot put their shoes in the healthcare provider. If someone tried to come in and jeopardize your licence that you worked years and years for, I'm pretty sure you'd get tired of that too. Healthcare workers and providers are people too.\n\nAlso to the reviewer that said they reported you to the law in California, that is a real thing and every provider has to report suspected abuse of any kind to the government and that is all they report, not your medical information. If you got in trouble, the law probably thought you were abusing someone, just saying. The hospital doesn't determine that, the police do.\n\nStop ripping on a hospital that is trying it's best to bring in good providers with the resources it has for a county of 60,000 people. So many locals worked very very hard to bring the inter-community hospital to exist. Stop thinking that providers are these machines that can read your mind, speak up if you want the care you want.",
